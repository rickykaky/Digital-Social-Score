Some of these uploads are music, some are comedy, some are anti BNP/EDL. None are espousing a particular movement, political group or ideology. However, due to the fact that I espouse equality and fairness & am opposed to unwarranted victimisation, oppression of minorities, hatred and ignorance it seems that certain users like to think of it as a soapbox to spew their racist, misogynistic, homophobic, xenophobic and hate-filled gibberish....the [ORG], of course, are guilty of all the aforementioned. Apparently my decision not to allow comments that are basically spam, lazy insults, illiterate ramblings and screeching from morons who don't listen (but just use the channel as their own forum) means I am anti free speech. I don't think our ancestors fought against fascism and for the right for freedom of speech to have hate-filled knuckle draggers abuse that by screeching hate-filled drivel bereft of facts, decency or, indeed, a point. I do actively encourage freedom of speech for all, quite often letting idiots speak makes them look far more idiotic than I ever could hope. There is a difference between debate and spamming, insulting, not listening and preaching though. I'm happy to debate, but a debate consists of two sides discussing their views, not one shouting and refusing to listen to anyone else. It is my channel and I have the right not to allow trolls, clones, neo [ORG], racists, haters and all round ne'er do wells the right to puke bile all over it....this is not suppression of freedom of speech and if anyone cares to look back through my channel they will see I actively encourage debate, but also see how so many choose to eschew debate in favour of: 1. Attempting to belittle, hurl abuse and calling me UAF/Marxist/far left/rapist/paedophile with absolutely no basis (libelous in reality). 2. Personal insults, accusing me of being a foreigner, bringing my family into it (they love a """"mum"""" insult) and accusing me of being several users because they can't believe more than one person can disagree. 3. Misquoting, paraphrasing and cherry picking """"research"""" from questionable sources and only ever """"research"""" or accept sources that back up their own beliefs. 4. Lying, accusing me of acts I haven't done and claiming they have """"won"""" the argument when they have ignored the points I raised and just harped on and on. 5. Cloning my account on here and also using my username on far right forums. They have cloned me numerous times. 6. Waffling on about being deprived of freedom of speech (to make insults and allow no right to reply by blocking me from their channels) Basically, these goons make up a tiny minority of incredibly arrogant, ignorant, spiteful, indecent, amoral, borderline illiterate joy sappers; [ORG], [ORG], neo Nazis, Islamophobes, extremists, KKK, you name it. THEY are what is wrong with the world and they are what is trying to stop us evolving; their motivation is hatred and ignorance....proven by their labelling of everyone who disagrees with them as communists, [ORG], Marxists and Liberals (and more unbelievably fascists?!?) with no basis. Of course, they are just lazy epithets to group the majority into one category when their opposition is made up of a multitude of individuals from left to right, of different coloured skin and beliefs, sexualities, classes, background etc....the majority basically. [PERSON] grants these guttersnipes the anonymity to parade their ignorance and disgusting ideals and appear to be a larger group than they are. They are fooling themselves though, they will always be a minority of failures who blame their own failure in life on everyone but themselves.

The problem is how you phrased the issue. If you are claiming admin abuse, you need to be specific. If you are claiming it is no longer needed, then your opinion of [ORG]'s original ban is irrelevant. When it comes to [ORG], admin are given broad and sweeping authority, because the community wanted them to have a hammer to deal with problems. Whether you deserved it or not, I have no idea, I didn't do that research and don't have time. I'm talking about procedure here. [PERSON]'s comments just muddied the waters, unquestionably admin have the authority to do moratoriums and the like on these articles under [ORG], and do topic bans. [ORG] isn't debatable because it is clearly spelled out in policy, so [PERSON] ended up making it less likely others would participate when debating something that is clearly not debatable, and [ORG] was on topic in addressing those points. Your points got lost in the mix. It happens. And [ORG] and [ORG] also piped in, it wasn't just one person. It was just one person taking your side, but he was mistaken on the procedural points. Even [ORG] jumped in to support the moratorium, and he isn't prone to jump into fires. Then [ORG] joined the fray. So 5 people participated, besides yourself, not just one. The problem being that you guys debated the right of the admin to impose sanctions (and he clearly has the right), instead of the circumstances of your situation, which is why 80% of the people disagreed with you and [PERSON]. You complain that only one admin has spoken, but that isn't true. Obviously, [ORG] is an admin, but so is [ORG] and [ORG], neither of which has a reputation for being heavy handed. Quite the opposite, actually. In reality, he could have put a one year moratorium on name changes and it would have been 100% supported in policy, but he chose a very short and reasonable period. You might not LIKE it, but the community voted specifically to give admin that power. If you had not muddied the discussion up by mixing both issues, your topic ban and his authority to issue a moratorium, you would have had a better chance, although odds are that the topic ban would have stuck because there wasn't any abuse in his doing so that I could see. It was his judgement. Disagreeing with it doesn't make it abuse. And the fact that it was only three months....that is the shortest topic ban I've ever seen, so obviously he wasn't trying to be heavy handed. Sometimes, you just have to accept that you don't have a case, and this one could easily be closed as """"no consensus to make any changes to existing sanctions"""". Again, I'm not up for debating, but I could care less about these articles, and if you want an honest review from an experienced admin, you just read it. - 2¢ """

I have only ever place three entries onto [GPE], and am the first to acknowledge that I have not made myself fully aware to the protocols of the site. After some 30 years of researching my ancestry, my primary aim was to share the information garnered on those few individuals who have been somewhat prominent in history. My upset comes from the fact that the editing was not sympathetic. You seem to have just wiped the article and started again. The upshot was that instead of leaving the information on the page [after all it has been there for some time-what is the rush to change it?] and asking for clarification, certain aspects just disappeared. If I understand it correctly, it seems that [ORG] prefers to quote as a source from [ORG] – because a contributor to [ORG] or [ORG] [a secondary source] has seen it, and delete my other quote from the Calendar of State Papers with source reference-because I have seen it personally in a printed book of the Calendars?

However the meaning of the text, as it stands now and as it stood before my edit, gives the impression that the RBS-15 is unsuitable for the majority of all targets, naval targets included. So, unless someone provides a cedible source that the RBS-15 is too large and expensive for all types of targets, the text has to be changed from it's current form, since it is highly misleading.

Then it says that, historically, other divisions (county, parish, not to mention districts that succeeded the ecclesiastical districts, then ward and constituency) have been the subnational divisions. It is anybody’s guess whether he latter are official divisions, relatively more official divisions than the vernacular ones of the 4 countries, or co-existing divisions with the 4 countries in the multiplistic complex arrangement that is the [GPE].

Take for example the pin-pen merger in Southern American English and in southwestern [GPE] or the non-phonemic æ-tensing that takes place in accents that have undergone the Northern cities vowel shift. The only reason I brought this up is because I imagine it is very noticeable to English ears (it's even noticeable to my American ears). Many English people might pronounce man as , which sounds quite a bit different from .

It is also against the Hippocratic Oath; which states: """"Do no harm."""" Circumcision is harmful to infants and the men that they will become. A circumcision itself takes 1/3 to 1/2 of the male shaft skin on the penis. It also takes over 2000 fine touch nerve sensors, the gentle gliding mechanism that is offered by the foreskin, and the protection of the foreskin itself. It causes unnecessary pain to the infant and the [GPE] does not block all the pain that an infant feels. In 1993, a ban was formed against genital cutting of infant females. Under the law the ban should also cover male infants too as the equal protection act states. It's time for all sexes to be protected from this barbaric practice.

b54c9836601eb78a,1,0,1,0,0,0,"""Kurt and [PERSON] get it on?== [PERSON] released his cock. For the past week he hadn't been able to get off. He tried a cocktail of drugs and a cocktail of whores. Nothing was doing it for him. Masturbating in the shower wasn't even working. Oh he was getting hard all right, he just couldn't fucking cum. And it was driving him nuts. To top it off, he didn't know why he couldn't cum. The girls had been either hot enough or slutty enough. Even the couple of guys he brought home had been decent. Despite that, he couldn't fucking cum. And a week of that was enough to make anyone more pissy than normal. Which meant band practice was unlikely to be much fun for anyone. That was made abundantly clear the moment [PERSON] stepped into the rehearsal studio. His eyes flicked from Krist to [PERSON] and he came to a sudden stop. [PERSON] was sitting on a couch, a pretty girl in his lap giggling. It was like he was taunting [PERSON]. And he would have nothing of that. Stalking over to the drummer and the floozie, [PERSON] pulled her forcibly out of his lap. The girl squealed and [PERSON] growled, but [PERSON] paid no attention, forcing the girl out of the studio. After slamming the door he headed back over to [PERSON]. Without a word he pulled the drummer to him and kissed him possessively. [PERSON] shoved [PERSON] away, """"What part of no don't you fucking understand!?"""" [GPE]'s eyes widened and he took a step forward, """"Guys, I think—"""" [PERSON] sent him a silent glare, silencing and stopping him. """"I don't want you, [PERSON]. I don't even fucking like you right now,"""" [PERSON] growled. """"In fact, I fucking quit! I don't have to put up with this shit. You're fucking insane. You need some other crackwhore to take my place. I'm not it."""" Sidestepping the singer, [PERSON] headed towards the door. He barely made three steps before [PERSON] grabbed him again. This time his back was pulled to [PERSON]'s front. He could clearly feel the singer's erection pressing into his ass. He wasn't going to be anyone's bitch. """"I'm just gonna... go,"""" Krist muttered before slipping out of the room quickly. """"You're fucking mine, [PERSON],"""" Kurt declared, licking [PERSON]'s neck. """"Always."""" For as small as he was, [PERSON] had more strength than [PERSON] expected. With considerably less effort than he would have figured, the singer forced the drummer down to the floor. [PERSON] wiggled and tried to crawl away, but all that resulted was in [GPE] pulling the drummer's pants off. Laying down on top of [PERSON] while he worked his own pants off, [PERSON] hissed in his ear, """"You're mine. You hear me? Fucking mine."""" """"Stop! Kurt, stop!"""" [PERSON] struggled. With [PERSON]'s weight on him, the drummer had very little maneuverability. He was completely trapped. But that didn't mean he stopped trying to get away. While wholly his struggling was probably a good thing, it wasn't really helping. If anything it was turning [PERSON] on more. Not having the patience to remove [PERSON]'s boxers, [PERSON] reached down and tore the back seam, exposing the drummer's ass. He didn't even pause to warn [PERSON]. His hands spread [PERSON]'s cheeks, spit down his crack to provide some lubrication, and quickly pushed his cock in. [PERSON] screamed, wiggling once more to get away. With [PERSON]'s hands holding onto his hips, he had no chance to go anywhere, at least not until the singer was done. [PERSON]'s screams faded into sobs. That alone drove [PERSON] further, faster. He loved everything about it. The way [PERSON]'s ass squeezed his cock better than anyone else's had before. He was a perfect glove, a perfect fit. Before too long a week's worth of unreleased cum spurted from [PERSON]'s cock. Slowly he pulled out, not really caring about the mixture of blood and semen leaking from [PERSON]'s ass. Grinning to himself he refastened his pants. He glanced at [PERSON], a feeling of superiority infusing him. He totally owned [PERSON] now. Does anyone have any basis for this rumour? I would love to put it on the main page. =="""

Please see our Manual of Style to understand the correct formatting and appearance standards. The one issue with your additions is that the captions for the images are entirely too long and full of extraneous information; image captions are not museum display cards and do not serve to detail every single item appearing in the image; [ORG] is an encyclopedia, not a museum. They should also never state """"note the x"""" or other similar attention drawing text, per [ORG]:[ORG], one of our guidelines on writing prose. They also had inappropriate use of capitalization, boldface and other formatting issues. For example, [ORG] spelling is never used for emphasis, as it is read as shouting on the Internet. As for [ORG] additions, I took them out for lack of relevance. [ORG] article is about the drink, not the company; that's at [ORG]. The information in those images is better placed there, but in the article text, not the image caption. The other reversions were based on similar concerns; the same sort of formatting and caption length issues were present there. In the one article, for example, the caption was nearly as long as the rest of the text in the article, when that text should really go in the article's body text instead. Once again, my apologies for biting your head off, as you were editting in good faith. I hope that my poor behavior doesn't turn you off to the collabrative process and that, with a bit of polishing, you can add much to our growing base of knowledge.

These arguments from design are described in the [ORG] argument article. They are rarely referred to as simply """"intelligent design,"""" and thus, have little to no claim to that term for its common name. A specific teleological argument is presented as science and an alternative to evolution. This purportedly scientific theory is called Intelligent design (ID) and it is described here, in the Intelligent design article. It is not necessarily associated with [ORG], and therefore claiming that this is the """"[ORG] version"""" is inaccurate. There are no strict """"versions"""" of the teleological argument anyway; there are different arguments from design made by different people, and they are identified by the philosopher/theologian who proposed them. From my perspective, the articles are well-organized, though not above improvements.

Could you please provide a diff in which I call people (pl) cunts (pl) or even a person a cunt? Of course you cant, but that doesnt stop you. I dont even care if you are blocked or not, I wanted an admin to make you stop making these outrageous accusations without providing any evidence. Earlier you made several allusions to various people who think I was socking. You back out of it by saying """"Im not the one accusing you, just other unnamed people do"""", as if that allows you to drop such an accusation with out one bit of evidence.The other problems with your comment aside, the accusation that you made that I """"breed cancer"""", that cancer being sockpuppetry, shows only how obsessed you are with directing fault to me. You think I am the reason [PERSON] or [ORG] socks? Really? I, hoping that I am right, will assume you say this because you are just unaware of the actual history, as opposed to purposely ignoring or distorting it. Much of this happened before my time here, but before I got involved in editing here I read a quite a bit of the history, through article and user talk pages and archives, [ORG], [ORG], [ORG], AN3, ..., and the arbitration cases. So I have a certain familiarity with the actors of this play and know the story fairly well. Once upon a time, there was a user named [PERSON]. This user has had their account """"vanished"""" to . Some things I dont know, as the user's talk page is deleted, and others dont need to be discussed, but this user vanished at the start of the [PERSON] case. The user already had a history of socking, how much is one of the things I dont know. This happened late 2007/early 2008, with his last edit talking place on Dec 24 2007. [ORG] was created Jan 3 2008. Canadian Monkey Dec 30 2007. Mr Hicks The III is an older sock, from [ORG] 2007. There were a few others created back then. All this before this monstrous creature you refer to as [PERSON] arrived and caused this man to start socking.Now, as for your [ORG] ([ORG]). The account [GPE] was given a topic ban after the CAMERA lobbying issue came to light in April 2008. One month later the [PERSON] account was created. One of the first things this account did was to go after, in a purely vindictive manner, one of the admins who had dealt with that issue. She, dishonestly posing as a new editor confused by the rules, was able to game the system into producing several blocks or bans against that admin. She followed him from article to article, going away from the A/I area into random areas such as Persian history. She was able to hide the fact that she was doing this for some time, until she was discovered as [GPE]'s sock and blocked. One month later, a new account, [ORG], is created. Posing as a new account confused by the rules, this new sock proceeds to do the same thing she did with that earlier admin with a new target (guess who?). She is able to successfully get a ban placed against her target. When this account is discovered to be a sock, a new account (in fact several) was created. Three separate accounts were blocked last time around, including one with no edits just waiting to be put in to use. So [PERSON] began socking prior to ever seeing me, yet I am responsible for her continued socking? And [PERSON]? I am responsible for dozen or so different accounts that I know that he has, and that isnt counting the ones from [GPE]? How can you possibly blame me for the fact that a number of die hard members of the Defenders of the Glorious Cause have repeatedly socked?But back to the point, dont make accusations that you cant provide evidence for. Either provide a diff of me calling somebody a """"cunt"""" or retract the charge. Same for the accusation that I knowingly overlooked sockpuppetry because I liked a user. nableezy - """

Some enthusiasts removed the word arguably when citing the source. Let's have a look at the law itself. Framework decision on combating racism and xenophobia Official Press Release Certain forms of conduct as outlined below, which are committed for a racist or xenophobic purpose, are punishable as criminal offences: ... public condoning, denying or grossly trivialising crimes of genocide ... as defined in [ORG] (Articles 6, 7 and 8) and crimes defined in Article 6 of the Charter of the International Military Tribunal, when the conduct is carried out in a manner likely to incite violence or hatred against such a group or a member of such a group. Example: Somebody publicly claims that an act of genocide, the commission of which has been established as a fact by an international court, never happened and was invented by the ethnic group concerned solely for the purpose of being able to claim compensation payments. This allegation would not only deny the genocide committed against the ethnic group concerned, but would also incite hatred against this group. In the future, all Member States would be compelled to criminalise such a case. Whether a specific historical crime falls within these definitions must be decided in each concrete case by the court which has jurisdiction. In the case of the Holocaust, for example, this was done by [ORG]. As we see, the law is restricted to cases, when: the commission of genocide is established by an international court and the denial is carried out in a manner likely to incite violence or hatred Is the commission of Armenian genocide established by an international court?

c14191d3b69c839b,1,0,0,0,0,0,""" WIKIPEDIA IS COMMUNISM!!!! It had been six years since we had graduated from college, and for the first time since graduation, all three of us were together again. From the enthusiastic hugs at the airport and then the conversation and laughter during the dinner we shared at a local restaurant on the way to my home, it was clear that while plenty of time had passed and we had kept in contact, the comfort and attraction between the three of us when all together in the same physical location was still undeniable. Having returned to my cozy, semi-secluded home in the suburbs, we all sat in the living room, sipping wine and continuing the tales of our lives. With the exceptions of the location – a house – and the presence of alcohol, it could have been any of our final two years of college together: The three of us, tight-knit friends-with-benefits, sitting and chatting and sharing a drink together. Then, [PERSON] and [PERSON] had been roommates while I lived in another dorm across the main quad; now, they were much-welcomed guests who had fortunately been able to clear time in their hectic schedules to come and visit me for a weekend. As I sat in the recliner and took another sip of wine, I allowed my eyes to truly linger on [PERSON] as she told [PERSON] about a recent situation at work. The [GPE] sun had certainly added a glow to [PERSON]'s skin, and may have also been responsible for the lighter shade of her shoulder-length brown hair. As when we were in college together, she wore virtually no make-up, just a thin gloss upon her lips – an enticing [PERSON] flavor, as I had discovered upon meeting her at the airport earlier in the evening – and red fingernails. Her red dress was indeed elegant, with a plunging sequined neckline that permitted a very welcome display of her cleavage, a display which [PERSON] and I both certainly appreciated. The long slit up the skirt of the dress revealed that she was wearing stockings held up by a garter belt, one of its descending white straps definitely noticeable against the well-toned thigh. The red heels provided enough of a contrast for the white stockings to truly attract the eyes. Surprisingly, however, she wore hoop earrings, something she had never worn during college for fear that they would pull at her ears and widen the piercing holes more than was considered safe. The conversation turned back toward me, but a few minutes later, the two beautiful young women were again chatting primarily to each other. I took the opportunity to once again study [PERSON], and was equally impressed. While noticeably shorter than [PERSON], [PERSON] was also paler in complexion, a testament to living in northern [GPE] ever since graduation and spending virtually every waking moment inside to conduct her research. As in college, [PERSON] preferred the color black for her outfits: a somewhat-tight sweater, form-fitting slacks, and a pair of low heels. Four tiny earrings adorned each ear, plus she bore a small sparkling stud against her left nostril. [PERSON]'s black hair flowed over her shoulders and down her front, and she absently twirled several strands around a finger as she listened to [PERSON]. It felt so good to be in their presence once again. Especially since all three of us had been in several failed relationships since graduating from college, I was thankful that I had thought to invite them to spend the weekend with me. I had absolutely no doubt that our chatter would eventually give way to intimacy, but for now, I was quite content to simply sit back in the recliner and openly admire the two stunning beauties perched upon the sofa. The intimacy began when we finally went to bed... together. I was on my back under the covers, with a very feminine head resting softly upon each shoulder. An arm wrapped around each of them, I held the two women close to me as they absently stroked my bare chest, dipped a finger into my navel, brushed my thighs through the sweatpants I typically wore to bed, caressed my stiffening manhood. My eyes closed, I reveled in their touches: inherently familiar, yet full of rediscovery due to the lengthy passage of time. No words were needed. And as their hands occasionally made contact with each other upon me, I smiled to myself in the darkness, having always enjoyed watching [PERSON] and [PERSON] in their own intimate encounters. But eventually, their touches slowed and ultimately ceased, their breathing falling into the regularity associated with sleep.

The consensus was that [ORG] is covered adequately in [PERSON] presidential campaign, 2008. [ORG] gets a couple paragraphs in that article. The relationship (if one can call it that) between [ORG] and [PERSON] was much more remote and brief than that between [LOC] and [PERSON]. Many elections nowadays feature guilt-by-association games, but [PERSON] is a bit different, because the coverage went on so long during the campaign, and the relationship went on so long in real life.

If a person is scratching their head wondering the name of some minister connected with this election, then the person can go to the article about [PERSON]'s 2008 campaign (which has a couple paragraphs about [ORG]). In writing this article, dozens of decisions were made about what the most important things in his life are, and those that aren't quite as important don't make the cut. Right now, some of us think it would be more appropriate to add more about his [GPE] service before the shoot-down, or more on [ORG], or more on his relations with [ORG] in the early 2000s, as compared to more about [FAC]."

I've been on wikibreak for a while so I haven't been able to follow what happened with the big """"plagiarism on the main page"""" discussion. I thought you might be interested as I recall you were one of the main drivers of that discussion. If it's still ongoing, I'd be happy to join in. I've written a little rant/essay on the bottom of my userpage about my frustrations with the lack of main page scrutiny. Hi, [PERSON] I've also taken a few days off, and am ever-so-slowly catching up; starting at the bottom of the page is as good a place as any! I actually did not intend to become a """"main driver"""" of the plagiarism discussion, nor did I intend to become """"Plagiarism Central"""", but alas and alack, so it has turned out ) What fueled that whole thing was me trying to discover how the """"reward culture"""" on [PERSON] was fueling plagiarism and copyvio at [ORG] to feed ill-prepared RFA candidates, and I never expected the problem to turn out to be as big as it has. Anyway, I think we can summarize what has happened with that discussion as 1) slightly more awareness of plagiarism and copyvio on [ORG]; 2) much more work for our few qualified copyvio people; 3) little change that I've been able to detect at [ORG] or [ORG] (but I don't follow closely enough); 4) circling of the wagons curiously in defense of copyvio by some [ORG] members and some extremely distasteful commentary coming from some arbs; and 5) curiously, even some resistance at [ORG] to tightening procedures to detect copyvio, with a second copyvio getting through [ORG] only a week after the Halloween mainpage debacle. On the copyvio you detected above, I'm not certain you handled it correctly by stubbifying the article, rather than adding the tag and alerting the copyvio people, you don't allow them to 1) look for other copyvios by the same author, 2) educate that author, and 3) remove the copyvio from article history. You might want to go through those steps as well. As to the lack of mainpage scrutiny, I 'spose it will take time, a few more debacles, and a few less unprofessional arbs before the issue is taken seriously. (Talk) """

Second thing, it seems like despite the heroic efforts, citations keep getting new problems with new edits. WB74 inserted a bunch of footnotes to support the claim that 22 charges or convictions of [ORG] workers have occurred. Unfortunately, these facts seem firstly motivated by WP:TRUTH, and only secondarily by citations. Nonetheless, I think something close to this number is probably right, and I have nothing against it being in the article ([ORG], it was me who edited a few days ago to say """"at least 15""""... I actually think the 'at least' is clarifying, but I'm not going to fight about those two words). At some length on this talk page, WB74 provided lots of citations, most of them from far-right opinion publications rather than reliable sources. In an edit today to the article, a somewhat different set of citations were provided. These seem rather sloppily collected. The first one I looked at was the wonderfully WP:[ORG] NYT; however, once I read its body, I saw that it had nothing relevant to the 22 claim given in the sentence (it was about [PERSON] stricter enforcement of registration requirements in 2006, perhaps in excess of the new laws according to the article). It was an interesting article, just not one having anything to do with the sentence it was listed next to. So I'll look through the rest of the added citations. I urge other editors to also pay careful attention to the relevance and accuracy of citations added by a certain set of highly partisan editors.

I propose to change it to a more conventional one like the one for [PERSON]. how is it vague? Do you mean, overly specific? This is the brief bracket explaining the [ORG] term, too short for a separate """"etymology"""" section, and too central to be banished to a footnote imho. I see nothing wrong with it. As always, if people don't know what a tatpurusha is, and would like to find out, they can click on the link. (ᛏ) It's vague for a first-time reader who may think its quite uninteresting or may wonder what is it. That tatpurush is a mouse-click away is not as far-away as the patience that is tested by introducing literary prowess right in the beginning. Besides, the order of merit usually is what, when, whose, etc. Its finer meaning can come in between this list or sometime later. This trend is seen in the pages like Ashok and [ORG] also. I would like the opinions of others on not only this page, but other such pages also because we must make them readable for the quick-surfer, and for the average [PERSON]. OK just keep it simple like [PERSON], instead of a """"tatpurush compound of..."""". That its a tatpurush can be mentioned later. this is nonsense.

See [PERSON], Ashvamedha, or any other article you care to look at. And no, we will not dumb down articles towards your image of a """"quick surfer average [PERSON]"""", we have simple: for that sort of approach. (𒁳) Please have a look at [ORG] and electricity, all of which either provide a separate mention on the etymology of the same in a section dedicated to explaining the same, or a very short and brief one (as in the electricity article). Ashvamedha, and [PERSON] similarly need to be cleaned-up from this imagined stretch of yours that """"we will not dumb down articles"""". Excuse me, this is a publicly viewable, highly accessible encyclopaedia meant for all.

ca3ef01734c54743,0,0,1,0,0,0,"""{{unblock|THANK YOU for a reasonable fucking comment!!! The ONLY USER in ANY AREA who has actually made one!! (Ebyabe made comments which appear to be reasonable at first glance, but are actually unreasonable because one is fraudulent and the other was untrue regarding a place where she could see that it was untrue.) Well a sort-of reasonable comment anyway because he claims that I am being """"confrontational"""" when it is clearly visible at my talk page that other users are attacking me and not the other way around. I have not caused any confrontation... I have replied to other users who are putting a confrontation to me. (I did ask how to report a user, but I did not actually report him because nobody answered regardless of several posts made, and the user himself did not comment there, so that was not a confrontation like it would have been if I'd been able to make the report.) I would like to leave a message at this user User:[PERSON]'s talk page but I cannot, because for some reason those are blocked to, so I have to do it this way instead. Hopefully he has the notifications turned on (tags of username). I can be calm and work with other people. This is noted in my first reply, where it gives several examples of how users should have had discussion instead of attacking and reverting me and arguing hostilely on my talk page. Users who wish to work with me should not make attacks, write words like """"compliance"""", revert edits when they could have further fixed the edit instead (details of referred-to edits in a separate paragraph below, make false claims against me, or delete my replies on discussion pages (not talk pages) and then ARCHIVE it after removing them!! (Users should not do these kinds of things to anyone.) What this means is that if users act in a reasonable manner, then a normal discussion can ensue (including from myself). Merely because someone has used a template, written a shorter reply, or wrote their aggressive, confrontational remarks in a business-style manner, does not mean that they are """"being reasonable"""" or """"writing nicely"""". When someone makes a falsified report about you or writes a falsified comment, etc., it is not reasonable to expect the victim to reply without mentioning this, or to want to """"be friends"""" with the attacker. If the other people are being reasonable then of COURSE I am going to reply to them in a different way. Editing an article by...(below) is not reasonable, nor is """"ganging up"""" (the discussion page), nor is replying in several places at once, etc. How can replying to other users stating bad and/or false things about you be """"confrontational""""? I have mentioned several times about having an actual discussion but no one did this and instead just kept replying on my talk pages. The fact that I mentioned having a discussion indicates that I think reasonable discussion is the right or reasonable way to do it. Just no one wanted to do anything but attack me so I did not have another way. The headlines are not """"veiled"""", they are in plain light. It was not any attempt to be """"hidden"""". For headline #5, I literally do or did not know of a different way to title this headline which is not an attack on myself. For headline #8, it is truthful and the falsification was blatant by [PERSON], and I actually expected her to edit it to something on her next message. I mean she directly mentions it; edit summary says a reason but her message says differently (directly, not implied). For this headline, it is not a """"personal attack"""" because it is true and evident: Administrator complains about my signature even though signature has been changed, and messages by me since posted, before the block happened, as well as direct linking to comments which contain no personal attacks as a reason for """"personal attacks"""". If the titles were UNTRUE they would be attacks, but since they are true unambiguously then they can't be attacks. The last headline yes, somewhat motivated/hostile, because he is the one put an useless headline so that there's TWO AT ONCE, *AFTER* my notice is up, while also writing the things that show the actual tyranny (a word used in this case solely because it is already being talked about, and not meant as any attack/instigation/hostile/etc.). Although the link by [PERSON] appears to say something about political opinions, if someone is making false claims then it is appropriate for them to be exposed. So as you can see my intents are to be reasonable and normal (with the 'possible' exception of this particular headline), and repeatedly asking other people to do this, but being annoyed by all their attacks and false remarks as well. Edits (in a separate paragraph so that reading it is optional): """"Users working with me should not...revert edits when they could have further fixed the edit instead"""" - Instead of reverting multiple times, attacking, and then harassing, the use"

It's a fact that people get paid to write biased things on wikipedia, and the content can be bought. If you believe wikipedia is an encyclopedia, with good information and other good things, then he's right, reality is a commodity. [ORG] told me so, and I believe what I read on wikipedia. vandalism does not make things better. So how many people with the attitude that """"reality is a commodity"""" does it take before it's reality? I have peer reviewed the idea that """"reality is a commodity"""" and I agree. In fact, I've decided to pick it up! I love this stuff. Fred pays [PERSON] to lob a brick thorough a shopkeeper's window. Who gets the blame? the shopkeeper! I see what you did there. But there's more backstory to that shopkeeper than meets the eye. So there's this shopkeeper, right? And this shopkeeper, he has a shop that doesn't exactly sell anything. He just stands in his shop all day, and gives people answers to whatever they want to know. Now people start noticing this shopkeeper, and they feed the shopkeeper information to answer these questions as well as asking them things they need to know. It becomes a tightly knitted community. Things go well, until people start to unquestioningly believe what the shopkeeper has to offer. These people here, they forget that people like them are the ones feeding him information, and that whoever fed the shopkeeper this information might be just as clueless as they are. But they keep asking, and the shopkeeper keeps telling. Then Fred here comes along, and notices this from an outside perspective. He notices the fundamental flaw in that the advice people are getting from the shopkeeper is just as flawed as the people who told the shopkeeper the information in the first place. So [PERSON] goes up to these people and points this out to them, but nobody seems to care. They're all happy as can be, asking their shopkeeper whatever they need to know and blindly believing what he has to offer. Some of them even retaliate against [PERSON] for disrupting their bubble of ignorance. Fred knows there's nothing that he, [PERSON], can do to stop this situation. But [PERSON] here, he knows that if something isn't done, people will continue to flock to the shopkeeper like cancer patients to the messiah. And [PERSON] knows guys.

Of course in this instance, the shopkeeper is [GPE]. The shopkeeper's devout followers are people who use the [ORG] religiously.

That would be the logical conclusion since he's one of the few in [GPE] for the riots, so why would he just hang around making assumptions about what they were complaining about without any evidence whatsoever? Even if [PERSON] didn't interview anybody, [PERSON] still did and he still came to the same conclusions so your point is absolutely moot. Your criticism is [ORG] getting ridiculous here. [PERSON] already says what the primary reason is (ethnic hatred), and one must assume that he had to talk to people in [GPE] to find out why, otherwise he would've made the same conclusion that you and many other misinformed do - that the riots were for nationalism/independence. The fact that the rumours of monks getting killed angered the residents and helped start the riots is already mentioned in the article. Not to mention that I ALREADY ADDRESSED THAT POINT OF YOURS. So what if monks getting killed is part of the reason why riots started? Does that point to nationalism or does that point to the same type of anger you or I would feel if we saw nuns getting shot by the police? I already addressed your """"proof"""" of nationalism by the Chinese flag being trampled. You are free to actually read what I say. And someone who attributes flag burning and pro-tibet slogans as proof that the riots were not because of ethnic hatred, but because of nationalism (and implying that the cause of the riots were for independence/autonomy) has no right to criticize how the current article is written. Your own """"proof"""" is 100% presumptuous, while the argument I make is actually from what the Tibetans have reportedly said. Until you actually find that someone in [GPE] being interviewed complaining about wanting independence or autonomy, or any evidence that the Tibetans rioted out of nationalism, besides your own presumptuous interpretations, then I advise you to drop the issue because you seem downright biased and unreasonable right now. Sorry, to say but the evidence is stacked against your view. Last, no one said it was all about the rising prices. If you read the article, it clearly states that the riots occurred for several reasons, of which only one was inflation. So basically, YOU ARE JUST SPECULATING. You cannot just include your own, personal opinions and interpretations into the article. The fact is that the reporters who were there actually described what the residents were complaining about, and at the very least, offered their professional interpretation of what the riots were about ([PERSON]), which is supported by their interviews with the residents of what they were complaining about.216.252.71.154 """

Regarding #8 (significance): Is the discography considered a list? I would assume so. I guess this would be why no image- photo or song sample is allowed within it. I would think this rule alone would suffice for removing all of the images I had put in the article, since they were all within the Discography section. Would it be acceptable to create a separate section for music samples, as in the [PERSON] article? If so, how many music samples would be allowed? 25?, as in that article?

75d5c1abc5b7fb25,0,0,0,0,0,0,"To ERS and others. I think LK's frustration appears to stem from a personal belief of injustice in that he believes the link to [GPE] website is being removed with an inconsistent approach to the [GPE] policies. This article does contain links to other websites that contain a great deal of unchecked or unverified information and it appears that he seems to want a level playing field. But I have emailed him privately to ask that he puts his position a little more diplomatically and I will the first to edit or scorn any more sarcasm. Equally, having looked at the history of changes, [ORG] does need to show some consistency here and apply these hard and fast rules to other links if appropriate. That inconsistency could easily be interpreted as a personal grudge, hence the obvious friction. The question of external links is quite clear in [PERSON]'s policies. If a site offers reliable resource material or is a good point of reference that is relevant to the article, then it can be included in line with those polices. I have briefly read the history section of LK's link and it does appear to be good information and is also well set out. It is neat, tidy and well formatted. This does perhaps seem curious to LK where some of the other links here have all sorts of advertising pop-ups and ticker-clickers with an obvious advertising and revenue bias. You state that you want proof of the charitable nature of the site but has that also been queried of the other sites that are plastered in adverts? Again, consistency needs to apply to prevent stoking of the fire. I will therefore check the [ORG] entry for this organisation and see what their accounts say. That will clearly show if the management of the organisation is drawing any financial gain which would put in a clear COI position if added in by him. But, does that totally exclude a site if it still provides good reference material. One could argue that [ORG]'s website should not be referenced from the article on [ORG] as it is a clear commercial entity. LK has pointed out [PERSON]'s own entry page, but perhaps not in a very complimentary fashion. On that page she has included links to her own site which does feature an advertisement to her book. So I come back to the level playing field issue. If you want to play referee you have to enforce the rules to both sides or one side will feel rightly peeved. I review and edit history books for a living especially those in this sector of interest and I am particularly noted for the integrity of data and cross-checking references. Elonka has stated that she objects to the link on the basis that it is not reliable, although there is no further detail as to what precisely. Therefore I will offer to read the entire website, especially the history section in detail, and see if there is anything factually incorrect, controversial or just plain stupid. Maybe one solution would be to generate a totally separate article on modern orders. But the fundamental matter is still whether the website is a good reference point. If it is, and the history details concur with published knowledge and this article, then it probably deserves its place. Maybe even more than some of the other links here that, perhaps, have not been subject to such a review? I don’t know because I haven’t read through those others. To be frank, it is quite silly that so much effort has been expended on this personal battle between the two of them and this debate over one web link. They could both contribute a lot to make this article a potential featured article. Who knows, they might even become best of friends in developing a fantastic article on a subject that we all enjoy. I will help out with proof reading and trying to make some of the writing flow a little better if that's okay with everyone."

f9eae09e97cca801,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[PERSON] ([PERSON], good faith, be nice...)... Winifred's painting technique for the pharaonic portraits: . . . I turned to the statutes and reliefs. These would show me how the sitters impressed the artists of those days, and the work of an artist's chisel or brush is at least as good evidence as the sworn word of a witness in a court of law, at any rate when the artist is as literal-minded as were the Egyptians. Do we not know the honest mistakes a man in the witness-box can make? And shall we not concede the difference between a trained and an untrained observer?The ancient artist was a trained observer; I would examine his trained evidence on what he saw, and compare it with what I could see today of the [FAC]. This done, discrepancies appeared which could not be disregarded. And besides, the various artists who portrayed a [PERSON] did not all agree in detail among themselves. This added to the difficulty! It was evident that some detailed and perhaps laborious comparing would have to be done. I had recourse again to the [PERSON], and took the face carefully back through the process of mummification. Certain confirmations appeared of the artists' evidence; these I accepted and retained, especially as they seemed to me to agree with the king's known character. Discrepancies on the other hand could be partly accounted for by the changes in the subject between youth and old age, and partly by the deference due to kings. Finally I did construct a firm scaffolding on which to build my portrait, and so the picture of [ORG] I was begun.The costume was a simpler problem. One had only to consult the monuments and the jewel-room of the [ORG], and to be careful to avoid howlers such as a dinner party parure with a field-service helmet, and so on. Ramses II was next attempted, and I was greatly cheered by the recognition of my resuscitated kings by several eminent archaeologists. Not all the [ORG] who recognised my portraits realised the method in my madness, the slow sifting of evidence and the laborious brick-making. To many they seemed flights of a fancy only slightly, if at all, controlled by research. ''But one of the most famous of them all, namely Professor [PERSON], gave me enormous encouragement. Whatever was to be thought of these particular portraits, he admitted that this was a line of research not hitherto tried, but perfectly legitimate and which might conceivably yield valuable results. His kind words so stimulated me that I made similar attempts with other defunct royalties, and gradually completed the series of kings and queens which appear in these pages."

292b7504a87d3eb7,0,0,0,0,0,0,""" ... Thanks for the quick response Khoikhoi. I was quite impressed with how level headed your second reply to me was (you didn't immediately go into a defensive ego trip like some others I've bumped into. Very much appreciated. A rare quality ). I will take your advice and will refrain from doing such edits temporarily. If possible though I still would like a little more clarification on the matter before I make any final decision on the matter. While there are occasional exceptions, a visit to virtually any article on any city in the world (new or old) doesn't show the pattern of a long list of multiple old not in use historically insignificant foreign names on the first line. For instance FYROM[GPE] title lists [PERSON], pronounced [ˈskopje], Albanian: [GPE], or Shkupi)[1] (their two largest demographics). There is no mention of older Turkish and ancient Greek pronouncement for [ORG]). So it seems very fishy to me that obscure Greek islands are seemingly being prioritized with old Turkish occupation names over major cities. Also I would like to note the Wikipedia:Naming conventions (geographic names) specifically states """"The title can be followed in the first line by a list of alternative names"""" (i.e. not """"must"""" be) It further clarifies the point (with regards to use of older historical foreign names on the first line)... Relevant foreign language names (one used by at least 10% of sources in the English language or is used by a group of people which used to inhabit this geographical place) are permitted and should be listed in alphabetic order of their respective languages, i.e., (Armenian name1, [ORG], Czech name3). or (ar: [GPE], be: [PERSON], cs: name3). Unless you can demonstrate that these obscure alternate foreign language name qualify as """"Relevant foreign language names used by at least 10% of sources in the English language or used by a group of people which used to inhabit the geographic place""""... I don't believe an obscure set of Greek islands remotely qualifies for this rule of prominent display. And this point of sensitivity to names is further clarified at the head of the geographic naming convention article where it explicitly states... Historical names or names in other languages can be used in the lead if they are frequently used and important enough to be valuable to readers, and should be used in articles with caution. Notice the words """"and should be used in articles with caution"""". I think it's pretty clear that the [LOC] are an extremely sensitive area with regards to names. (it stirs the pot for old ethnic conflicts) I think perhaps you've misunderstood my motivations here a bit. The issue for me wasn't whether the names could be mentioned (they obviously always should be in there somewhere)... but exactly where in the article they are mentioned. Unless it is historically important (e.g. Constantinople) any mention of older historical Turkish or Greek occupation names should only be added later in the article in a historical or etymological context.... not be given equal airplay upfront with current names or historically unimportant names. Doing so is both bulky and highly provocative to sensitive political regions. (and incidentally the same rule should apply for inappropriately using historically insignificant Greek names for Turkish cities) I'm sticking to my guns that my edits were kosher according to existing [ORG] geographic naming conventions and current widely observable conventions. I'd even go further and suggest leaving those old historically insignificant foreign names prominently displayed is far more disruptive than removing them (both in a [GPE] sense and in a human toll sense) I therefore would like to once again remove those old names from the first paragraph but will delay pending your response to me (to confirm I have (or have not) convinced you of the accuracy of my assertions) Thanks in advance for all your help.

Bottom line, the difficulty of changing the governance is not unique - though it's clearly a special case of being even harder. The only solution is to keep trying to come up with new ideas. [ORG] The problem is not so much being given the tools indefinitely; the processes for removal of tools where that's clearly warranted are not so bad. The difficulty is in handling low and mid-level problems, and a certain tendency from people who've heard [PERSON] cried too many times to dismiss any problems short of """"desysop now"""" seriousness as either bellyaching from troublemakers or just minor stuff of the """"everyone makes mistakes"""" variety. More organised, constructive feedback might help, eg having a mandatory [PERSON] review every year. talk """

0246ec773b78950f,0,0,1,0,0,0,""" Cash I am a walmart assocate and I do feel there is a link between [ORG] managment and servant leadership, and here is why. The managers are not in charge of the store, the hourly associates are, they take orders directly from the customers. The customers are consitered under walmarts policies to be the boss, the hourly assocates are next in that order and so on. This is a backwards model that was set fourth by [PERSON] himself and is maintained by the current board. [ORG] survays are conducted every 3mos to a year, this survey is a rating of each manager, and is then reviewed by the district and [ORG], then changes are made. Each level of management must answer to the hourly assocates, and so it is kinda a push/pull managment system. Take my own situation for an example. heres what happend, one night I am short of assocates in the [PERSON] is where I work) Temp logs did not get done, of course this is a major mistake, I was """"written up"""" for this. However I did not feel this was fair, so I wrote an email to our district manager explaining the situation, he then forwarded the matter to our regional VP. Our VP came to our store, flew in from bentonville mind you. To deal with the situation, he met with me for about an hour and also met with some other deli assocates. After a week he calls me and tells me that he can not get rid of the Written warning, however that all of the managers that had been informed that we where short, would be on probation for the next six months. I was satisfied with the outcome Because, While I was not fault free in the situation, management however was informed that I did not have enough people to help customers and deal with the food safty logs, and they failed to act accordingly and I was not happy with it, so in the end I punished them for their poor perfomance. So you can kinda see why they consiter it a servant leadership. Also Cash I hate the way you term 'vast left-wing conspiracy' I am myself a liberal and we liberals are not part of that conspiracy ideal, that would be your union leaders and right-wing large business owners, that are anti-walmart, As much as you would like to identify us liberals with the unions we are in no way assocated with them, infact most of us liberals dislike the unions just as much if not more then you right-wingers. Because the general public tends to identify unions with [ORG] and this is because most union voters, vote on the liberal side, this does not mean that they are liberals, just that they play the politics game. True liberals hate the unions and feel that they are just as bad or worse then a currupt big business. With a currupt big business atleast you know what they are and they make no bones about it, with a union they want to be your friend and then screw you. lol. On the part about this entry being [GPE] it is very much so [GPE] however I have given up tring to balance it out myself the Anti-Walmart people always revert your edit and then threaten to get you banned for the three revert rule when you attempt to make any edits, its a freaking joke the way they act. However I have just taken on the Idea that they will destroy the entry to the point where people look at it and just shake their heads and how full of BS it is."""

It's clearly no longer a start anymore, and developing some clear structure and order. Some of the language is still a little choppy in places, and could use a good copyedit by a native english speaker. The history section seems to be a little heavy on the subsections, and some of those could be combined. Some of the subsections overall could have shorter and more concise titles as well. There are a good number of photos in the article, which is good, but they seem to be cluttered over on the right side of the article, and should probably be placed a bit more evenly. Also, many of the image captions are very, and should be shortened as well. Photo captions, as a rule, shouldn't really introduce any new content to the article, and should be brief enough to simply describe the photo they're attached to. All photos should also be relevant to the article text and sections that they are placed in as well, with some sort of text in the main article discussing it. A couple of wiki guidelines and such to help out: WP:LEAD for improving the lead section, WP:CITE for the formatting of citations, and WP:MOS for general manual of style information. While there's no specific guideline at WP:CITIES for South American cities, editors might find the [GPE] city guideline to have useful information nonetheless. It may also help to take a look at the Good Article criteria as well as the Featured Article criteria, for tips on moving towards those review/rating classifications."

We decided to move it over here. [GPE] is currently in the category of """"French emigrants to [GPE]."""" But is [PERSON] an """"emigrant""""? Given that she was an American citizen at birth (because of her mother's American citizenship). Hope it's okay to print our discussion as a dialogue. (Certainly it's dramatic...) ME: Here's the legal definition of """"immigrant"""" (and emigrant is just the inverse, of course): """"An Immigrant is a person who has citizenship in one country but who enters a different country to set up a permanent residence. Just entering another country does not make you an immigrant. In order to be an immigrant you must have citizenship in one country, and you must have gone to a different country with the specific intention of living there."""" It seems clear that [GPE] does not qualify as an immigrant, since she already had citizenship. For this reason she can't be an emigrant either. Agreed? I don't want to revert your edit myself - as it looks like an editing war; I'll leave it to you to do the reversion, if we're in accord here. OBI-WAN-KENOBI: I don't think emigrant is a legal term in our category structure - it really is more about what happened. She grew up in [GPE], speaking french, and then moved, leaving [GPE] behind, for [ORG]. I think calling that emigrant is fair - regardless of citizenship status. emigrant: """"a person who leaves one place or country, esp a native country, to settle in another """" Also, you can be an immigrant and an emigrant at the same time - it's really a question of perspective. ME: Yes, you in fact HAVE to be an immigrant and an emigrant at the same time. You can't be one or the other. Hence the definition of """"immigrant"""" is all that matters. My problem is that to call Filipacchi an """"emigrant"""" is in fact *incorrect*, looked at from the perspective of the [GPE] government. It doesn't have to be a legal matter - I'm simply regarding this as the most rigorous definition that we have. This is taken from a legal site that advises [GPE] citizens on how to emigrate to [GPE]: """"The [GPE] government considers an immigrant to be someone who is not a [GPE] citizen, but who has received clearance to permanently reside in the [GPE]."""" http://www.immigrationassist.co.uk/immigration/us-immigration/ What this suggests is that it is logically impossible to emigrate to the [GPE] if you are already a [GPE] citizen. OBI-WAN-KENOBI: Emigrant doesn't have the same legal definition - and it arguably applies, because """"[GPE]"""" was just as much """"her country"""" as the [GPE] is. we'd probably best bring this to her talk page in any case. That's where it stands now. Currently she is in the emigrant category. Thoughts? """

It is a Catholic doctrine, yes, but we need to keep doctrines voiced by all of Christianity and parts of Christianity distinct in this article. The Protestant stance is that babies, both born and unborn, whatever they do, are not held accountable until the age of accountability, or the age of reason, at which point they know the difference between right and wrong. [ORG] also holds this idea, so I'm wondering now how babies could go to hell when they can not be held accountable for sin? They have their inherited sinful nature (original sin), sure, but that's different from actually committing a sin.

That would be surreal, and would give User: Physicq210 a moral legitimacy belied by his actions. And so, the following request for unblocking is directed at any administrator BUT User: Physicq210, but since I’m not a devious sort, I have nothing against the latter reading this. Indeed, I want User: Physicq210 to read it. For if I can be banned from [GPE] for standing up to censors, then it is vastly preferable to go down fighting, than to go down the long dark road of self-abnegation and self-censorship, including the use of bad English. After all, if I wanted to be a lackey, I could go to graduate school. [ORG] http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents User: AuburnPilot A few days ago, User: AuburnPilot began stalking me, checking wherever I had made edits, and going to the articles in question and vandalizing them. He or she has been manipulating [ORG] rules as cover for what is clearly political censorship. User: AuburnPilot cannot even stand for [ORG] readers to find out about factual material that upsets his political applecart through footnotes. Zero tolerance! He claims of any source he politically dislikes, that it is either “spam” or a “blog” (or “[ORG],” another favorite dodge for those at [ORG] seeking to censor those who fail to conform to their own [GPE]), even though the one source is a previously published, classic magazine article otherwise unavailable on the Web (http://geocities.com/nstix/waronpolice.html), which the author has seen fit to publish on his Web site, and the other source is the longest, most thorough exposé yet published on the [ORG] rape hoax (http://vdare.com/stix/070113_duke.htm). Note that I am not even talking about censoring writing within articles, since I hadn’t done any writing on the articles in question: Crystal [PERSON], [PERSON], 2006 [ORG] lacrosse team scandal and Racial profiling. I’ve been involved in edit wars before, though I have never been the aggressor, and have never initiated an elective edit war, though given the self-assurance that aggressors such as User: AuburnPilot exude, perhaps I ought to reconsider that position. It seems that aggressors rule here. The reason I am making a formal complaint is that User: AuburnPilot has tonight upped the ante, threatening to have me banned (http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:70.23.199.239&redirect;=no), if I do not surrender to his censorship. Should you find for me, please serve this individual with the wikiquivalent of a cease-and-desist order. Should you, however, find for the censor, please provide an Index of banned publications and a list of official wikicensors. [GPE] January 19, 2007 115A EST. Since beginning this complaint, I see that User: AuburnPilot has in fact succeeded at getting a crony, [ORG], to block me, thus not only getting administrative support in censoring me, but preventing me from responding to his thuggery. (And no, I am not going to use cutesy, euphemistic language. If I were into such deception, I would have become a liar, er, lawyer, and would be worthless as an encyclopedist.) And I was unable to e-mail User: Physicq210 because I am not logged in and “You must be logged in and have a valid authenticated e-mail address in your preferences to send e-mail to other users.” (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Emailuser/Physicq210) If this isn’t cyber-Stalinism, I don’t know what is! So, let me get this straight. Stalking and censoring an editor while using the equivalent of smiley faces (User: [ORG]’s penchant for saying “Thank you” after vandalizing one’s links) is “civil,” but complaining about such abuse counts as “spam, disruption, incivility, and personal attacks.” If that is verily so, then 2 + 2 = 5. P.P.S The message here says that I was “temporarily blocked from editing [ORG] as a result of your disruptive edits.” What the heck is that supposed to mean? For restoring footnotes and links that User: AuburnPilot had vandalized? If that constitutes “disruptive edits,” then you’ve utterly given up on honest English and all human decency. Sorry, but I don’t have any sympathy for the [ORG]."

Having read and re-read this article, I cannot understand why this section of the Jared [PERSON] biography even exists for several important policy-related reasons. First, there is the policy issue of undue weight. It would be understandable that this section existed if [PERSON] is known for his anti-Semitism or (more importantly) finds himself being the subject of journalists who cover his alleged Holocaust denial. After all, [ORG] is a terciary source that relies on publicly verifiable secondary sources that document subjects in a [GPE] fashion.

Furthermore, even the Anti-Defamation League does not accuse [PERSON] of such things.

I'm not suggesting that inconvenient facts and criticisms found in reliable sources cannot be included in this article. I simply have not found them.

Copy the info from articles on challengers into the campaign articles. Then slap redirects on the articles on challengers (if of questionable notability) so that there is no need for [LOC] for these.

That might include a rating/evaluation of the quality of each article. 2D - (Optional) - do the same for the 30+ Senate races. (I just looked at the [ORG] campaign article the other day - except for the polling info, it's devoid of any significant content except primary results.) 3 - Improve the quality of wikipedia bio articles for incumbents in competitive races (defeated or not), winning challengers, and notable but not-winning challengers: good citations, good copyediting, etc., as baseline for 2008. 4A - (Starting mid-2007?)

Remember that what """"rings true"""" or is a """"state of mind"""" based on reports that turned out to be wrong in the end, and cannot be fully verified, cannot be included in [GPE]. If at all, all sorts of conspiracy theories could be included (and even there I have my reservations) in a very specific article, say 14-M Bombing attacks at [GPE], but not in the general [GPE] article. It would be similar to including a sentence in the History section of [GPE] saying that the [PERSON] administration was behind the 9/11 attacks, according to some sources. Or, as you know, there are hundreds of conspiracy theories of """"[GPE]"""" against [GPE], of which I could find dozens of """"sources"""", some of which, to many people """"ring very true"""", but they are not included in [GPE], and probably should not, as you would probably agree. But I would be more than happy to ask (an) administrator(s) and other users with good-standing for their opinion and/or mediation, if you like. """

Title reign tables, etc I made tables for the Title reign part, hope that's okay. 21:17, 23 Mar 2004 ([ORG]) As the author of the Title History section, I think that the tables are horrible. I didn't make it that way because it's ugly for anyone that has low screen resolutions. They are also harder to read in my opinion. At least, with my presentation of the information, they were easy and straight forward to read. 02:10, 28 Mar 2004 ([ORG]) Finally created an account here, I'm the one who made the tables. Well, I think that my version of the Title History looks better and is better to read. But maybe I'm the only one who thinks that way? I'd like to hear other opinions. I changed the look of the tables a bit, do they look okay? Title Reigns WhatWhoWhenWhere Extreme Championship Wrestling World Tag Team Title (with [PERSON]) Defeated Sabu & Tazmaniac February 25, 1995 [GPE], [GPE] Lost to Public Enemy1 April 8, 1995 Philadelphia, [GPE], 6 Apr 2004 ([ORG]) I have made two versions of the """"Title History"""" tables now. You can see the other one at Stone Cold [PERSON]. I think the table in [PERSON] article is a bit long. The table in Benoits article might be unfriendly for users with lower resolutions. What do you think which table should be used for [ORG] for the wrestlers? 12:54, 20 Apr 2004 ([ORG]) Do you really need a mini-paragraph for every [ORG] title event [PERSON] has? I mean, in a year, is anyone going to care that [PERSON] had a [GPE] title match against [PERSON] at [FAC]? Having a detailed account of every [PERSON] appearance on [ORG]! is not only tedious, it's unnecessary. - Regarding [PERSON] having """"Super Tombstone Piledriver"""" as a [PERSON] does regularly, um, no. At one time, a very long time ago, he was doing piledrivers as part of his moveset, but he hasn't done a piledriver, super or otherwise, in many years, dating even well before the ban on dangerous moves in [ORG]. At this point, anyone who even knows that [PERSON] did a piledriver at one time should be rewarded for their knowledge of very miniscule trivia. I'm removing it. Someone can consider adding it in as trivia if they like. [ORG] TAP OUT come on he says that! err I think [PERSON] does actually have the record for the longest time in [ORG]. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Rumble#Royal_Rumble_Records ToneLa IMO, the [ORG] section needs a little bit of an overhaul. There's the background as to what led to him and [PERSON] having an affair ([PERSON] told them to travel and appear in public together to maintain kayfabe, to the point of having [PERSON] grope [PERSON] in bars) leading to the various """"[PERSON] booked his own divorce"""" comments over the years, [PERSON] changing her name legally to [PERSON] (I'm 99% sure of this, as [PERSON], who's friends with [PERSON], exclusive refers to her as """"[PERSON]""""), and I'm pretty sure he and [PERSON] had a second child together. At the end of [ORG] section (where it discusses [PERSON]'s neck injury) it states [PERSON] injured his neck in a match with X-Pac. However, I remember reading a quote by [PERSON] himself where he stated that he actually injured it in a match with [PERSON] (while taking a stunner) and the superplex in [ORG] simply injured him further. Can anyone verify this? Factual verifications What nees factual verfication? Everything looks right to me.

Anyway, I saw you add the info back, so I added a reference to it so it doesn't get reverted again. I encourage you to add references yourself in future, so that hopefully this doesn't happen again (and please note that references don't have to be online, they can be offline, such as the reference I added to the 2011 season article).

I request that (a)be unblocked, and (b) review the issue that I want to be edited. I was just trying to discuss why a page was locked with the reason that the person was alive, even though the person was dead. I do not understand what I did wrong in my edit and my comment was kept being deleted. I wrote that a literary work by [ORG] has been considered antisemitic by some and provided a link to the article in [ORG] that states exactly that and discusses why many argue that the work is antisemitic. I was also under the assumption that the talk page is to discuss with a senior editor why the edit is being deleted."

a43a5be8a17eb6a4,1,0,0,0,0,0,"Please stop vandalising my writings in the dog article Nothing in my writing here is controvertial and in need of citation. It can all be looked up by the reader on any level. Do you need citations that dogs did not decend thousands of years ago from the wolves that are alive today, as most people believe? Do I need proof that they decended thousands of years ago from the wolves that [GPE] thousands of years ago? Why does this need citation? Is this your problem? I am merely pointing out the error that so many, many people make. They hear that dogs decended from wolves, and they look around and see the only wolves left in the world in any number today are the wolves of northern lattitudes...they see the grey wolf of northern Eursaia and the timber wolf of [LOC], and believe that all dogs decended from them. Humans are a tropical creature that moved into the colder regions. Everywhere man goes, wolf populations dwindle, as anybody knows, and in ancient times, before man, there were wolves all over the world, adapted to their own climates. What part of this needs citation? Obviously, the first dogs to be bred were the ones where the people first lived, which is obviously the warmer climates, and it was THESE wolves that gave rise to most of our dog breeds, not the northern wolves. Now the wolves of the colder regions are the only ones left in number, the wolves in warmer places, where dogs were first bred, are almost all gone. Some northern breeds decended from northern wolves, yes. The spitz breeds and sled dogs, etc. This is all so obviuous, can you tell me what part of this you don't understand, and need citations about? I feel like I am talking to a child. If I tell my child that [PERSON] was the first president, to I have to give a citation? This stuff doesn't need citation. You are a vandal, because you, as the only person on earth who doesn't agree with this, erased three whole paragraphs, not once but twice, on the grounds that there were no references, even though much larger tracts of the article are more controvertial and have no citations. You erased every word I wrote, even though all of it is true, none of it is controversial, and this is nothing but pure vandalism. You need citation that dogs interbreed with coyotes? Why? How can you not already know that? How is this possible? And articles about the Russian jackal-dog hybrid are all over the web. Can you use a search engine? Look up the pre-caudal gland in any veterinary text. Things that are controvertial or new need citations to the new or controvertial sources, but when something become so widely-known that it can be found in every reference work out there, it no longer needs specific citation. For anything I wrote, you can look it up in [GPE]. If you read something that you did not know, it doesn't mean the author needs to cite references for you, it just means you need to do your own homework. I am merely pointing out the things that are such a big part of common knowledge, and using them to prove that dogs did not all decend entirely from modern wolves of the colder climate where people didn't even live when dogs were first domesticated. In all my years of veterinary practice, I have probably told 100's of my patients that dogs decended from warm-climate wolves, NOT all of them come from the northern wolves. Now, after all these years, I am confronted by a web vandal who tells me I have to cite freaking references about this. It is purely annoying. If you erase my writings again I will report you as a vandal. Really, do NOT do it again. [PERSON]"

While many people believe this concept - some even go to great lengths to self publish books on the topics, there is no way to scientifically prove the concept, nor is there any way to verify generally accepted documents that could show this is even a possibility. The rumor that [PERSON] was black rages about based on two quotes, one by [PERSON] himself (where he says he doesn't know if it could be true, the other a rumor started by his future father-in-law meant to destroy [PERSON]'s business and reputation.) Consider verifiable these [ORG] on the matter: 1) [PERSON]'s alleged """"black"""" lineage can not be proven through [ORG] forms, death certificate, or any other [ORG] SOURCE document. As far back as the 1850 census (the first to name all people enumerated, and designate their race) [PERSON]'s father and mother are enumerated as white. This is most frequently dismissed by [PERSON] followers who claim the census forms were doctored after the fact as part of a [ORG] cover-up. 2) There is no DNA proof of [PERSON]'s alleged """"black blood"""", (nor is there proof that [PERSON] fathered [PERSON]). 3) [PERSON] was not raised as a cultural """"black"""" that is to say that he was not raised within the black community, and therefore would have not had the same cultural experiences that other blacks in the era would have had. 4) """"Black Harding"""" promoters will point to [PERSON] Chancellor's book on [PERSON] as proof of government conspiracy. And it is interesting how swifty the government worked to squash the book and get its copies. But if one looks at Chancellor's research methodology (and we step away from those who claim that the book was supressed) - all of it based on hearsay - any student in college today who would present this type of research in the form of a paper, masters thesis or dissertation would have been thrown out of college for faulty research! 5) Some of the promoters of this theory of [PERSON]'s """"blackness"""" on """"family stories"""". While folklore is not always untrue, folklore can be embellished from storyteller to storyteller. Ask anyone who studies it, folklore is at the mercy of the one who passes it on. 6) The promoters of these theories go to great lengths to attack the people who poke logical holes in their wishful arguments. They can not refute the facts, so they attack the people who question their beliefs. Take a look at the """"reviews"""" of [PERSON] books published in the past ten years in places like [ORG] and [ORG]; online and you'll get an idea how some people will attack those who do not buy into the black """"Black Harding"""" myth. If [ORG] were to add information that [PERSON] was the first black President, without irrfetable proof, it simply ads another chain in the long list of unrliable misinformation. """

You are obviously not aware of what is goinf ´g on I am ban for not contributing at all with the talk page!! what ? I am the one who asked for this mediation for more than 2 weeks ago and it was for something else than that and this snowskinner who was asked to bring the arbitration knows it perfectly. And i am the one working out ot bring the two best cosmolog in the world to look at those thesis, ans I am the one who did contributed the most in this affair together with [PERSON], at the refute of those falsifications of evidencies presented here by ybm and his acolytes. I was ban because ybm had been ban and couldn't stand it. But where he was ban 24 hours for insulting repaeatridly people and calling [PERSON] a bastard 3 times and for having on several occassions oversteped the [ORG] rule, I was ban 3 x 24 hours for having presented an article who was evaluated by [PERSON] who is a very endeared friend of [ORG], for not being so usefull as she wish. An article containing of course a serie of evidenscies who didn't have been shown before, and who constiture a major block against the conspiratorial arguments of ybm and his gang. Just as she did it here on my talk page when she deleeted it all, and vnever reinserted it, a precious document proving the ´factual connection between [PERSON] and this [PERSON] who infatuated this whole affair. It was [PERSON] who had invited his friend on my talkpage, until he realized that i had an arbitration going on that was about this. [PERSON] blocked me 20 minutes after her protegé had been blocked. i dont see any of her interventions in this talk page concerning the insults of rjb and ybm, nor concerning their cynical and very empty and longs comments about my mediation on the talk page tonight. You can read my articles yourself and see how hard I was fighting to make sure that the situation will not degenerate further, and to calm down the spirit. She didn't make an intervention there to ask rjb and ybm to stop their acction and provocating attitudes, nor accused them for saying nothing nor removed their articles for not improving the talk page, nor contributing with anything on it. She has already been told to don't interfeer anymore on this talk page because she is unable to differentiate between her liking and her work as an admi. She does not follow the rules and do a very destructiv work, using retaliation and arbitrarious judgement all the time, and always something who arranged ybm very much. She even do revert for him and use her status to commit illegitimate stuff. The arbitration should have been about this too. They are using the fact that mediator [PERSON] turnbull is out for a week to do their bad deeds. And this snowsnippers know that what he does is out of hand, and that he should never have done it. He even insulted [PERSON] turnbull. Easy when people aren't there to defend themselves. Wiki english is a spot on the face of [GPE], admi are behaving like sabotors and vandaliser and encourage riot, and abuse of their knoledge and power to undermine actions made to refrein their wrong doing. This has to stop. I asked for a mediation and an arbitration comity for more than two weeks and Sowspinners actions are completely unlegitimate. He has stollen MY mediation and MY arbitration request. This don't go and has to be aborted. I do not recognise the actual arbitration for being legitimate, and thereby ask all to boycot it. None of the involved administrator can in anyway be part of the arbitration comity or of the arbitration. It is a close debate and not an arena game. THis arbitration was supposed to be hold secret, as snowspinner knows very well, and took some very unlucky initiatives from the very beginning. He is an idiot to have done that, and has no sens of responsability, nor of maturity, and cannot be trusted. He must be removed as well. i dont accept what happened tonight. There was absolutly no reasons for me to be blocked and certainly not for 3 days.

Hello, although this is technically an unblock appeal, it is really only a reason to explain.... you won't be in a mood to unblock me when I'm finished talking... ) First of all I want to apologise, I should have thought before putting the giant swastika on my page. This is the reason for that... I have a few Jewish friends, and normally we sometimes make jokes about jews and christians and things like that. I never really make jokes about the holocaust, because that never go over well with them and it is not nice... well, apparently, a joke about jews being lawyers set one of my closest friends off who is not really a jew, but claims he is.... now he thinks I am a facist, nazi, and I hate jews.... i gotreally frustrated and annoyed and so I came home and started messing around on my userpage... Second of all, i would like to ask why it is not permissable to """"self identify as a nazi""""? There are several userboxes dealing with this subject. There is even a userbox that states, """"This user identifies as a Hitlerist! WHAT THE HELL?!?!?! You will let people say they support [PERSON], but you won't let them say they are nazis?!? Being a nazi does not mean that you condone [PERSON] or his actions, it simple means that you support the theory of the politics behind Nazism.... you can be a nazi and not support the horrible eugenics policy. But if you are hitlerist, that obviously says you support all that... your arguement would of course be that it is offensive to jews.... well if you are taking that into account, then you should also ban anyone that says they identify as a communist. That can be extremely offensive to christians... if you want me to, I can talk about all the horrible things they did to christians in communist [GPE] (with reference of a nice book). I think I will... one of the things they did was putting shackles on the ankles and wrists of christians with spikes of the inside that cut into your skin if you moved at all... and then they put starved rats into your cell that tried to eat you alive so you had to fight them off while your wrists and ankles are killing you. They also tied you to a cross and hung you upside down over a huge pile of other prisoners crammed into a small room. You were then forced to excrete over everyone. You were also stood upright in a box while they drove long nails into it. It was alright if you stood perfectly still, but you would have to stand there for hours and then your body would sway and poke into the nails. They also stood you naked in a freezer with a doctor nearby that signalled when you were freezing to death and then they would take you out and warm you up. They would do that for hours on end. Then they would beat you over and over again asking you to renounce Christ... the holocaust was horrible, but I would rather be gassed or hung by a nazi than endure those tortures for 18 years like one man who wrote a book about his experiences... so could you ban all communists please? My last comment is in response to [ORG]'s question about me making the 'gay comment' statement. Nowadays the word gay is used for two meanings... one is homosexuality and the other is wierd, stupid, dumb... i was using the second connotation.... maybe if you people didn't spend so much time on this gay... sorry... stupid online encyclopedia you would realize how the real world uses words...

In fact, completely and utterly stuck and rather despondent about it all.

What was the Czech political-cultural context, and how did this produce the magazine? """"Conservative"""" is too vague - I think readers will benefit from being told more about Czech conservatism. Then there's the magazine itself; who started it (and what were they doing before this?); editorial policy, contributors, transfer of ownership (if any) and whether or not the magazine has changed since its acquisition by the media group. Put it this way: certainly in the [GPE] (and probably in the [GPE]), an award for growing the best cannabis plant isn't something usually associated with a conservative magazine... I'll put this page on my watch-list. I'll be happy to sort out any copy issues, btw. Best regards, Thanks for your opinions, [ORG]. You are right, the article is not balanced. I'm trying to use only sources independent on the magazine itself, and unfortunately the sources deal mainly with controversies. There is an overview of the history of Reflex in the 20th anniversary issue, I'll try to expand the article with that information and answer your questions. Btw, [PERSON] is sometimes really considered as a conservative magazine; could there be a little difference between the perception of the term in the professional and well-developed Anglo-American journalism and the perception of still """"young"""" independent Czech journalism? Using of this term in the post-communist world is quite complicated, as conservatism defends traditional values and continuity, and the first free post-communist media (including Reflex) had to start building again; to some extent they had to find the values and the interrupted tradition. The provocative cannabis award could be an attempt to test the borders of freedom of speech and to come closer to independent and bold journalism. This is, however, just my vague point of view. We should probably avoid this association on [GPE], as this is a world grown in a completely different tradition and experience. Again, thanks for pointing out the problems. I'll work on it. I've attempted to expand and clarify the origins and background of the magazine as recommended. Yes, I've been hovering over your shoulder the whole time!

Yes, the [ORG] issue is the main reason why I asked for your help. [ORG] was the owner, together with [ORG] and [PERSON]. He seems to be the most important one, according to my sources.

The fact that a very large amount of his original work, some 4000 negetives, has survived and been kept together in just two large collections for approximately 100 years is one of the main planks of his notability. The other plank is when and where he practiced. The subjects of his photographs, the people, their clothes, their floating and their static palaces etc. etc. is what is notable. This collection is a unique, historical, visual record of a long dead era. It is not just a collection of photos of old boats. [PERSON] was uniquely positioned to photograph a distillation of an aspect of society. That aspect of society existed here and there, now and then, throughout this and other countries. But it came together for a short period each year at Cowes in what I have called a distillation. He did photograph it and his work has remained together, its existence, until recently, known only to a small group. The trustees of the two collections feel, I am sure, that the photographs are too valuable to be published willy nilly on the internet. In any event that would be impractical and was not my intention. My plan had been to try to make the collection's scope known. Not as an advertisment but as a dissemination of information. As an analogy consider the article about a national collection described in page 10 of today's [ORG]. The article describes the collection and claims or advocates its importance. The Collection was started as [FAC]. [ORG] details of [PERSON] are not central to the theme of the article, an account and illustration of the contents of the collection is. 15:00, 1 May"

1ae6c9564f40175f,0,0,0,0,0,0,"([ORG]) For the sake of anyone reading this in the future, expected value is actually fairly easy to determine. A (barely) simplified version of the formula for this discussion is: Number of Decisions * Average Bet * House Edge = [ORG]. On a single number, single spin bet of $1 as the table suggests the [ORG] according to that formula is 1 (decision) * 1 (bet) * 0.053 (edge, rounded) = $0.053. For 10,000 spins at $1 the [ORG] is $530 meaning the casino wins $530 as stated. To determine the player's edge for a straight up bet take the chances of winning (1/38) multiplied by the payout (35) plus the chances of losing (37/38) multiplied by the loss (-1). (1/38 * 35) + (37/38 * -1) = -0.05263 or a loss of $0.05263 per dollar bet. If you do the math this is the same edge for any double-zero wheel bet except for the top line. As a random side note, to quickly determine the payout for any combination of numbers: 36/(numbers bet) - 1 = payout. For example a street is three numbers so 36/3 - 1 = 11 therefore a street pays 11/1. 08:24, 17 February 2012"

He wears a metaphorical mask of normalcy throughout the film, establishing himself as a cool-headed schemer and gaining the trust of those around him (""""You are most gracious my liege"""" - """"I assure you your highness, it won't happen again""""), despite his rather untrustworthy physical appearance. Even with this mask, [ORG]'s villainous tendencies tend to seep through and become apparent to the viewer, particularly in the opening sequence, where [ORG] displays no remorse in sending [ORG] to his death in the Cave of Wonders, simply proclaiming that """"[PERSON] was obviously less than worthy"""" in a rather dry tone of voice. The deleted song """"Humiliate the Boy"""" also establishes [PERSON] as an emotional sadist, getting a laugh out of seeing """"another fellow's dreams turn into nightmares one by one"""" and treating the [PERSON] in an especially harsh manner (one only has to watch the video, a link to which is provided, in which [ORG] viciously tugs the [PERSON]'s beard several times whilst shouting orders like """"Do as I say""""). It is not until [ORG] gains control of the [PERSON]'s lamp that he fully shows his true colors, becoming even more arrogant and short-tempered with his subjects after usurping power from the Sultan (""""Don't talk back to me you big blue lout!

It is this impulsive behavior that leads to his downfall, as he uses his third wish to become an omnipotent genie, unaware of the life inside the lamp that he now has to endure. [ORG] is usually shown to be somewhat comedic and [PERSON] (giving a slightly human side to his usual malevolence, a trait not often seen in [ORG] villains), even in his times of evil and cunning, proclaiming """"[PERSON]..."""" when contemplating decapitation.

This comical humor does not carry over in the film's direct-to-video sequel, which aimed to make [ORG] more sinister and ruthless, though it is referenced in [ORG]'s role in """"Hercules and the Arabian Night"""".

2250ebe3581ef161,0,0,1,0,0,0,"""Kurt and [PERSON] get it on?== [PERSON] released his cock. For the past week he hadn't been able to get off. He tried a cocktail of drugs and a cocktail of whores. Nothing was doing it for him. Masturbating in the shower wasn't even working. Oh he was getting hard all right, he just couldn't fucking cum. And it was driving him nuts. To top it off, he didn't know why he couldn't cum. The girls had been either hot enough or slutty enough. Even the couple of guys he brought home had been decent. Despite that, he couldn't fucking cum. And a week of that was enough to make anyone more pissy than normal. Which meant band practice was unlikely to be much fun for anyone. That was made abundantly clear the moment [PERSON] stepped into the rehearsal studio. His eyes flicked from Krist to [PERSON] and he came to a sudden stop. [PERSON] was sitting on a couch, a pretty girl in his lap giggling. It was like he was taunting [PERSON]. And he would have nothing of that. Stalking over to the drummer and the floozie, [PERSON] pulled her forcibly out of his lap. The girl squealed and [PERSON] growled, but [PERSON] paid no attention, forcing the girl out of the studio. After slamming the door he headed back over to [PERSON]. Without a word he pulled the drummer to him and kissed him possessively. [PERSON] shoved [PERSON] away, """"What part of no don't you fucking understand!?"""" [GPE]'s eyes widened and he took a step forward, """"Guys, I think—"""" [PERSON] sent him a silent glare, silencing and stopping him. """"I don't want you, [PERSON]. I don't even fucking like you right now,"""" [PERSON] growled. """"In fact, I fucking quit! I don't have to put up with this shit. You're fucking insane. You need some other crackwhore to take my place. I'm not it."""" Sidestepping the singer, [PERSON] headed towards the door. He barely made three steps before [PERSON] grabbed him again. This time his back was pulled to [PERSON]'s front. He could clearly feel the singer's erection pressing into his ass. He wasn't going to be anyone's bitch. """"I'm just gonna... go,"""" Krist muttered before slipping out of the room quickly. """"You're fucking mine, [PERSON],"""" Kurt declared, licking [PERSON]'s neck. """"Always."""" For as small as he was, [PERSON] had more strength than [PERSON] expected. With considerably less effort than he would have figured, the singer forced the drummer down to the floor. [PERSON] wiggled and tried to crawl away, but all that resulted was in [GPE] pulling the drummer's pants off. Laying down on top of [PERSON] while he worked his own pants off, [PERSON] hissed in his ear, """"You're mine. You hear me? Fucking mine."""" """"Stop! Kurt, stop!"""" [PERSON] struggled. With [PERSON]'s weight on him, the drummer had very little maneuverability. He was completely trapped. But that didn't mean he stopped trying to get away. While wholly his struggling was probably a good thing, it wasn't really helping. If anything it was turning [PERSON] on more. Not having the patience to remove [PERSON]'s boxers, [PERSON] reached down and tore the back seam, exposing the drummer's ass. He didn't even pause to warn [PERSON]. His hands spread [PERSON]'s cheeks, spit down his crack to provide some lubrication, and quickly pushed his cock in. [PERSON] screamed, wiggling once more to get away. With [PERSON]'s hands holding onto his hips, he had no chance to go anywhere, at least not until the singer was done. [PERSON]'s screams faded into sobs. That alone drove [PERSON] further, faster. He loved everything about it. The way [PERSON]'s ass squeezed his cock better than anyone else's had before. He was a perfect glove, a perfect fit. Before too long a week's worth of unreleased cum spurted from [PERSON]'s cock. Slowly he pulled out, not really caring about the mixture of blood and semen leaking from [PERSON]'s ass. Grinning to himself he refastened his pants. He glanced at [PERSON], a feeling of superiority infusing him. He totally owned [PERSON] now. Does anyone have any basis for this rumour? I would love to put it on the main page. Um... No. Just no. Did you pull that out of some dirty sex novel or what? Talk Reverted undo; suspected vandalism =="""

Besides, [PERSON] discribed there is NOT Nakhichevan with its current bordering. Grandmaster, don't get offended but up to now you have demonstrated that you have no clue of what you are talking about. [PERSON] as a whole, in its pick, the population jumped to 150,000, it was its most important period, after the 13th century it was replaced, in 14th century, it droped to about half of its prior population, it lost its statue, at 15th century it was taken over by Armenians from the vicinities of [ORG], and after the desertion of Ani, people moved there. [PERSON] alone represented a significant portion of the entire population. The closest to the [PERSON] period you cam is of over 200 years, while I provided data which covered that period. You are the one making up things which you can in no way backup. Here, let readd the materials I have provided. For the next four centuries, Armenians, who had begun their dispersion after the fall of [PERSON] and the Seljuk Turkish invasions in the eleventh century, continued to emigrate. In the meantime, [GPE] ( [GPE]) experienced a revival under the Shi'i Safavids, who became the adversaries of the Sunni Ottomans. From 1501 until 1639, the two fought each other periodically in [GPE]. Armenians were uprooted during these wars, and, in 1604, some 250,000 Armenians were forcibly transferred by [ORG] to [GPE]. By the seventeenth century, the Armenians had become a minority in parts of their historic lands. The merchants of [LOC] in [GPE] were among those who were brought to [GPE] by Shah '[PERSON]; he moved them to a suburb of [GPE] where they built the [LOC] community. The support of '[PERSON] and subsequent shahs enabled the Armenians to expand [GPE]'s trade with [GPE], [GPE], [GPE], and [LOC]. These merchants helped to make [LOC] an important trade center. [ORG] of the Russian and Soviet Empires by [PERSON], [PERSON], [PERSON]. p. 44 [PERSON] devastated his frontier areas, which included parts of [GPE], as a defensive measure and so displaced nearly all the population.

[PERSON] covers the evacuation in her work The Shah's Silk for Europe's Silver: The Eurasian Trade of the Julfa Armenians in Safavid [GPE] and [GPE] (1530-1750), I don't see anything about Tartars being evacuated or an undiscriminate evacuation, or any reference of an important Tartar population in [GPE]. [PERSON] while visiting the devastation reports destruction of Armenian towns and its desertion, not Tartars. Sir [PERSON] during his visit in 1812 has only discribed the destruction of the Armenian city during the evacuation. In 1603 Shah '[PERSON], the great Safavid ruler of [GPE], sent an expedition into [GPE] in answer to the appeals of the inhabitants for assistance against the Turks. The death of [ORG] in December 1603 and the succession of his son [PERSON], a boy of twelve, opened the way to an easy conquest in the course of which both retreating Turks and invading Persians plundered the Armenians.

3a34d0d65a3caf45,0,0,0,0,0,0,""" [PERSON] sorting guidelines I sincerely believe that we really need to lay down the law in stub sorting, and really provide a guideline. I believe that we should all attempt to reach a general consensus by April 2, 2005 in a set of rules that we can follow. Once we have built a set of guidelines, we can formally create a policy out of those guidelines. We need to define what a specialized topic stub is, how many articles it should cover, when is it appropriate to create it, what defines its need for its creation, what defines its need for deletion, what criteria it should follow, what are the general steps should one take when sorting a stub, whether or not to start using subst: for all templates, whether or not use subst: for all templates created by the meta-templates, and any other matters that may come up in consideration. I thank for initially creating the subpage for the project at Wikipedia_talk:[ORG] sorting/Guidelines. Even though they have been discussed, I feel that we really need to confirm everything. For that, we should discuss each issue with its own sections, and raise a list of issues that we need to nail down before really continuing on. [ORG] is nearly at [ORG] articles. Either the [ORG] software needs to handle stubs such that they can be found with a simple union of categories, or the sorting is done manually by Wikipedians. Personally, I think the latter is less taxing on the server load, especially when we use subst:, which I think would help the [GPE] out, performance wise. Please make your comments at Wikipedia_talk:[ORG] sorting/Guidelines. I apologize for making this somewhat of a spam notice, but since the project has more members, the project can finally decide on these important issues at hand. (talk) 23:23, 15 Feb 2005 ([ORG]) That thing you did ‘’Hi Gadfium - a while back I was having trouble with some geography stubs, and (via [FAC]) you found out for me that they'd been created twice, and fixed them. What did you do?’’ Just delete and restore the article which is appearing more than once. If that doesn't seem to work, try refreshing the category that they're in (edit the category page and then change the URL to say refresh instead of edit), and as a last resort, make a trivial change to the duplicated article to force a change to the database. 01:47, 16 Feb 2005 ([ORG]) changing geo-stub this is bordering on the absurd. I have ended a number of my articles and stubs with [LOC], and someone has changed them to just plain stubs, so now I make it just a stub, and someone comes in behind me and changes it first to a geo-stub and then to an [LOC]-stub. 07:09, 17 Feb 2005 ([ORG]) Nuthin' to do with me - and anyone involved in the [PERSON] sorting project should know to leave it as a oceania-geo-stub. Which articles do you mean? |hello? I don't even know precisely which articles they are anymore...most of my recent edits have had to do with the islands of French [PERSON] and [GPE]. I haven't bothered to look at who's changing the stubs, or if perhaps it's a problem with the db (I've had on occasion to submit several times...) 07:46, 17 Feb 2005 ([ORG]) The db may be the culprit. These stubs are very heavily used and the system does seem to slow down a bit with them. Not sure why that would result in the multile template changes though. As to an overhaul of the names, that would mean changing 50+ different regional stubs which between them are used on close to 10,000 articles. It's simply not practical. |hello? Ah. I will look into it. [GPE] has always been something of a side-bar interest for me, since they seem to be the """"left-out"""" islands.

If you have any doubts, then check the discussion page for that article. It wasn't long ago that all references to """"Keith Wigdor"""" were removed from this """"surrealism"""" article. This removal occured because of [ORG]'s total unimportance to the surrealist movement, for the simple reason that [PERSON] is, at best, an emerging digital artist who fancies himself as a being a surrealist, and who has many times attempted to pose as a surrealist. Needless to say, many of the english-speaking surrealist groups listed on this page know about him and refuse to have anything to do with him. [PERSON] appears again and again to disrupt all things genuinely surrealist. It is also interesting to note, if you check the discussion archives of this """"surrealism"""" article, that these same 2 users were also involved with promoting [PERSON] as a surrealist, in this very article. Also, if you look at some of the recent, belligerent, trollish, thike-ish posts of these 2 users, it shouldn't be unreasonable to suspect that perhaps both of these 2 [ORG] numbers are being used by [PERSON]. For the 2 no-name users mentioned here, who are strongly associated with or strongly correlated with the antics of [PERSON], it is difficult to imagine that their efforts in building this wiki article will be anything but disruptive and manipulative in the long run. Please treat these 2 users with extreme caution, for they are one and the same, and also happen to be [PERSON], who is playing a sock-puppet game. 22:10, 11 Jan 2005 ([ORG])"""

Second point - you should only refer to 'homosexual romance' in the lead if there is a section that deals with 'homosexual romance' in the body of the text, as the lead is a summary of what is in the body, and having ten sources does not count for much unless the terms are unpacked somewhere in the main text.

Now let me refute your argument regarding the transitive property: A) 1=3(1/3) B) 3(1/3) = 3(0.333...) C) 3(0.333...) =0.999... The problem here occurs in B) where you assume that 3 * 0.333... = 3 * 1/3. You have 'not proved' anything. On the contrary, you have only proved that you are assuming 1/3 = 0.333... which it is obviously 'not equal'. 0.333... is an 'indeterminate' number because it cannot be represented finitely in base 10. 0.333... is not equal to 1/3 so you cannot say that 1/3 is a finite representation. An indeterminate number is a number that is repeating in any radix system. You mention the division algorithm but do you know what it says? The division algorithm has 'nothing' to do with radix systems. Let me state it for you - If a and b are two given integers, there are unique integers q and r such that a=bq + r and 0<= r < b. Now I will use the division algorithm to prove that you are WRONG once and for all. Suppose a = 1 and b = 0.999..., then what are the integers q and r such that the above is true? Suppose that q = 0 and r = 1. Then the division algorithm fails because it makes a false statement i.e. q and r can both be 0 and 1 respectively. For example: 1 = (0.999...)(1)+0 and 1 = (0.999...)(0)+1. So by default, the division algorithm is proved false if 0.999... is equal to 1. And you can say a lot of things about the [PERSON], but they would not make a stupid mistake like this. They were the smartest race in ancient times. Now suppose that you try to tell me that either form is acceptable in the case of 0 and 1, you will still end up with a terrible contradiction: 1=(0.999...)(0)+1. The second form in this case implies that 1 < 0.999... since r < b. But how can 1 be less than 0.999... ??!! I want the world to know what f..g idiots run this site.

It seems to me self-evident that if Mr. [PERSON] controls the copyright, then we can't use the image other than under the conditions he dictates.

Its correct name is [ORG] olivieri Gray subsp. istanbulensis [PERSON]. I have corrected it. I hope the anonymous user will not change it again. Best regards, (To reply) Hi Réginald. If you hadn't arrived on the scene, I was going to ping you. I removed the Turkish image and link, since I didn't think they were germane, but I left it to you to fix the taxonomic details. Does [PERSON]'s classification, as it appears in the article, contain all the known species of [ORG]? [LOC], The page contains all the recorded species, but not the infraspecific taxa (i.e., the numerous subspecies). Originally [ORG] olivieri subsp. istanbulensis was for this reason not included. For consistency reason including it required to mention also -as I did- the two other subspecies olivieri and [PERSON]. The issue is: if we want to be fully consistent we have to mention also all recorded subspecies (with their distribution as for that of C. olivieri?), among others the numerous subspecies of the variable C. biflorus. A niggling work! I am afraid that the page will become too scholastic. Your advice about this issue? Best regards, (To reply) [ORG]: You can find a quite complete list of species and their subspecies on the [ORG] taxonomy browser. Type """"Crocus"""" in the """"search for"""" bar. (To reply) Thanks for the link—that's a great resource. I don't think we should worry about its being too scholastic. My main concern would be with consistency: I'm not sure if there are comparable articles that also list all subspecies. The information about subspecies certainly should be available on [GPE], but should it go in the main article or in the more specific articles about each species (of which there are now only a few). I don't know. For consistency reasons I have added the other subspecies reported in the [ORG] taxonomy and cited the source. I agree that additional paragraphs or articles should be written for the most representative species, in which a detailed description of their subspecies would then be done (as e.g. I have done in fr:[ORG]). (To reply) Okay. I'd be happy to help with creating new articles and refining translations, if you want to go that route. Just remember I don't know what I'm talking about ;-) [LOC], I have removed again the the logo of [GPE], that User:[ORG] had added again to [ORG], explaining the reason for doing it (see User talk:Terzinator). Hopefully, he/she will not add it again! Best regards, (To reply) Thanks, [ORG]. I don't do edit wars, so I'm glad there's someone else diligently watching the page.

On 01:27, 5 August 2010 I posted a section on """"Talk: Death of Adolf Hitler"""" titled “Random Questions” which started “I am not a scholar, I read Wiki but would not think of editing it. But I was disappointed in this article, and many points in the discussion, so I am asking some questions. Perhaps someone else will read and address them.” The section went on with several rethoritical questions, and ended with “As to sources, the last books I have read are The Murder of Adolph Hitler by [PERSON] (sort of shaky) and The Last Days of [PERSON] by [PERSON] (English translation, I buy much of this).” [PERSON] was apparently assigned me as an administrator, because at she replied with: ”As the article lead says,...This said, this talk page isn't a forum for talking about personal views or questions on a topic, it's meant for talking about sources and how to echo them in the text. I say this because the article seems to already cover, with thorough citations, most if not all of what you've brought up...dodgy. [PERSON] (talk)” By this reply it appears that [PERSON] is NOT FAMILIAR with the work of [GPE], who I have just referenced, and thinks that I am asking a personal question, not a rhetorical one.

Almost every instance of """"shit"""" was removed, consistently with #^$& or similar characters. Also, certain important lines had their translations changed. """"Back then, you could get by with only skinned knees"""", for example, was changed to something likely more grammatically correct, but weird to a long time player of the [ORG] version. I have the PC version of FF7 and I recall a TON of Cid lines where there was censorship as well as ones form [PERSON]. They were all situations of anger though so it didn't impact the storyline much.

Another person conceded the point with the comment that """"It does seem to be the case that [ORG] originated the 45° orientation...."""" though they did not necessarily originate that use, [ORG] did independently alter their use of the symbol for their specific desire to highlight the """"S"""" letter for """"socialism."""" Of course, the additional comment that they didn't use the 45 degree orientation consistently also concedes Professor [PERSON]'s work showing that their leader deliberately altered / evolved the symbol from its historic orientation into meshed """"S"""" letters for socialism. The graphic resonance is highly suggestive... and in fact it is compelling! In fact, one of the flags that Dr. [PERSON] cites argues for that thesis: The swastika itself comprises two S's, and that is shown to have been known consciously when the German National Socialists overlay two additional S's for another group (as German National Socialists had other examples of similar alphabetic symbolism). Hitler even altered his own signature to reflect the same """"S"""" for socialism and similar alphabetic symbolism still shows on [GPE]. http://rexcurry.net/book1a1contents-swastika.html The leader of the German Socialists had no reason to harp on this idea because he was an ex-artist.

So yeah, you can listen to Deathcore if you enjoy hearing """"music"""" that has no tempo or beat to it whatsoever, they pretty much just hit random shit on the drums and play random notes on the [PERSON] while the vocalist does terrible random screaming and pig squels. Don't forget the hillarious millions of breakdowns they put into their songs. """"DA...THIS SONG IS CALLED BIG FUCKING TREE!"""" """"Ya boi....we are so down wit [ORG]..[PERSON], my hair does that flippy thing.. [ORG] SO LYK HARDCORES OMGZ@!!!@@!!!! [PERSON] AND SNAKE BITES RAWWWRRR"""" Fuck Job for a Cowboy and Black Dahlia Murder, trendy pieces of shit. [ORG] owns all. There really isn't much of a difference between any """"Deathcore"""" band for that matter, they are all just a bunch of pussies that are trying to fit in with this new trend of trying to be a """"Metal"""" band. So please don't try to tell me """"OH...YOUR STUPID...THE BANDS AREN'T THE SAME."""" Ok, so maybe....JUST MAYBE.. Job For A [ORG]'s vocalist does 3 more pig squels in a second than the vocalist from [ORG], there I said it! I guess they aren't all the same!!!! Oh dear fuck ..... And my bad...my bad, [ORG] actually does 200 breakdowns in a minute rather than Suicide Silence's 100 breakdowns in a minute. My bad dude you were right all along!! Deathcore and [PERSON] bands aren't all the same!!!!!!!!! But seriously, the genre is pure shit and is just another trend in the music industry that bands are following to """"make it to the top"""" and to fit in with the rest of the bands these days. I mean, I have nothing against every band in a certain genre sounding the same or anything, but when the """"music"""" of the genre they produce is pure shit and can be done by any living human being on [LOC]...then I have to draw the line. It doesn't take much talent to do shittty raw screaming, hit random notes on a guitar, and hit your double bass pedal at like 500bpm. Another reason why I don't take any bands from this genre seriously is their hillarious excuses for a """"band logo"""". They try oh so hard to be """"HARDDCOREEEEE"""". I also find it funny that all of these pussy bands have names like, """"ANAL CUNT"""" or """"DEAD DEATH BLOODY DEAD HAND"""". Fact is, any band that produces """"music"""" under this genre sucks and is just trying to fit-in. [ORG]! LETS HARDCORE DANCE! RAHHHH [ORG]!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! [PERSON] and [PERSON] isn't Metal so all you douchebags should just give up....you aren't Metal and you never will be, go fall into a pool of [ORG]'s.

It's not enough simply to have a source when adding genres to an infobox: The """"genre"""" field should be limited to genres that describe the album (or group, or whatever) in general, and not every genre that has been incorprated into it. Imagine what the [PERSON]' infobox would look like otherwise. The sources you are citing are not necessarily supporting the genres you're adding: for instance, Earles says: """"Side B is ... proto-Sabbath sludge metal or proto-noise rock, depending on how you wish to retroactively consider this stuff against the underground rock history that came before and has transpired since ... etc etc doom metal scene etc etc power- and thrash-metal movements ..."""" ... it takes quite an imagination to read that and conclude that My War is a """"sludge metal album"""".

a826ce6df9f3e0d7,0,0,0,0,0,0,""" Well, not that i don't appreciate what you said, but even so, allow me to reply. Today there were the funerals of [PERSON], a [PERSON] as few remains in a world more and more without any respect for freedom (seen as a 'threat for the established order'). The oil price is flying to 100$ and this should led to think more seriously to our absurd world. But let's go: 1-there is someone that is costantly pointed at the 'words' while others are pointed on 'facts'. Since you call my comment 'above' as non-polite, obviously you miss why i could be not friendly with someone that not miss a time to complain in [ORG] every time we discuss in any sense. This is 'polite' and wikilove for you? To me it not looks so. Since i am a volonteer here, not payed (as all the collaborators as well), you cannot pretent i act like all the conformists here have established, and obey to [PERSON] or BillCJ every time saying 'yes master, yes master, like you want master'. And surely i wouldn't take EH as 'bright example'. Sorry, the manner in which they acted not displays any reasonable friendly-acting. So it's hard pretend to me to be so kind with gentlemen that not even bothers to explain why they does this and that revert. 2-Another thing that show dramatically well some things: Take for instance, the first paragraph after the header """"Technical description""""...the paragraph ends with the sentence """"the only real all-around fighter that served in [ORG], but this was not without limitation in every task."""" That's a very subjective statement, and, since it's making a judgement, it really needs a citation so that the reader can understand what the source of that statement is. As it stands right now, however, because it is not cited, it merely looks like opinion on your part, which would be right to remove/revert. All the [ORG] page explains continuosly why this plane was 'limited' and 'mainly successful as recce'. I cannot understand how this thing, considering all the datas and stuff given, can be 'questioned'. Rather than criticize me just try to get a look about the JAS-39 Gripen. Basically, questioning this fact shows apalling comprension for all the article, because it's a statement well placed inside the meaning of this work. 3-Washing your hands and not bother about to collaborate with me is not surely a 'nice' manner to do. Strangely enough, this is 'justified', rather than be a guilth. So, basically, every thing i do or not do is wrong, while every thing you do or not do is right. With these bases, expecting a costructive dialogue is just funny. You have been 'offensed' by the vanification of F-104S adjustements (because i after done some more contr.). This is the only thing you did in over a month of 'collaboration'. Too easy, my dear, to self justify all times like you. Easy not bothering to collaborate, while the guilth is mine that already lost my time to contribue gratis to this ency. 4-My contributions should be alway quoted here and that. But being serious, there are a lot of pages without any or almost any references. I dont' understand why i should be whipped to post 500 kb. The issue about F-86 data touched the buttom of the sea and dig it too. I cannot cope with someone that not even read online sources with absurd reasons. 5-The continuos accuses, diffamations and so on about me are not liked either. Perhaps the problem is that [ORG] takes herself too seriously in the last times? Perhaps that be called 'traitor' or 'harmer' is not friendly? Obviously you rate these accusation as 'righful critics'. But not i. I remember very well that you accused me without any proof to make copyviols, even with funny interpretations of [ORG] text (that i stated as not mine, the only time i used other texts in all the MB written for the sake of [ORG]). I wouldn't have a judge like you in the real world, believe me. 6-The fantastic wikioz world, 'tooooo perfect' to be 'questioned'. But to me and some others, this looks not exactly true. There are a lot of burocrats, hipocrites and trolls, or simply there are a lot of guys that basically fears the others and are ready to 'defend the Revolution' with zealot fanatism. Questioning even the basical celebral activity and even the basical freedom of spreech, questioning even the simply syllogism. All this is due because, as always in these cases, from French revolution today there are always many 'revolutionary guards' ready to show their 'loyalty' to the 'cause'. So wikipedia prefers executes guys 'out of the chor' instead to admit to have some 'contradictions'. This is the usual manner to act. And i have no love to who call me 'wiki.harmer' just because i show that i 'know' my stuff, not only 'have read it somewhere'. This is why [PERSON] and many others keeps away from"

I replied to you above, with a different indentation level and separate signature. [ORG] focuses on major events when they occur, not on subsequent remembrances (excepting rare instances in which they're extremely noteworthy in and of themselves). — The 2011 [GPE] attacks were added to the 22 July queue and probably will appear on the main page next year.

In fact, you could have added the item to the active list yourself before the page was automatically protected yesterday. But I suppose it's easier to jump to conclusions and blame others than it is to collaborate. — I don't """"do"""" collaboration, even if I did, marking the anniversary of one of the worst terror attacks in European history should not be something that requires """"collaboration"""".

At the time of the collision I was soundly asleep in the junior officer bunkroom tucked under the flight deck in the forward section of the ship (We were standing [FAC] and [ORG] watches under Condition 1 AS, a modifified form of anti-submarine battle stations) when a loud noise was heard and a brief shudder passed through ESSEX, a 29k ton anti-submarine aircraft carrier.

[ORG] did not suffer any apparent damage to her nuclear reactor or powerplant. No leaks of radioactive material were reported as testimony to her thorough construction. ESSEX's bow mounted sonar was badly dented/deformed but the ship's water-tight integrity was never breached, and she transited to [ORG] for repairs and deployed in late May 1967 for an EASTLANT NATO Anti-submarine exercise (ASWEX)."

5f59ac13c49b269a,0,0,0,0,0,0,""" There is a difference between [PERSON] the band (which this page is about) and [PERSON] the corporation. As Far as Pink Floyd the band is concerned, [PERSON] has not been a member since 1985. A member of a band is someone who plays in the band. Further, [PERSON] has no rights to any of the new music/albums that have come out since he left. i.e. [PERSON] of [ORG]. Once again showing that he is no longer a member. Finally, [PERSON] does not need permission from [PERSON] to release albums such as [GPE]. He does get paid royalties, but that is it. Further, I fail to see how you could list """"The estate of [PERSON]"""" as a member of a band. Does the estate play the piano? No. It receives royalties for sure, but that doesn't make it a band member, it makes it a corporate member. I agree with [PERSON] that they should all be listed under former members. This is inline with the template on [GPE] for musical artists. I would challenge anyone to find a [GPE] page on a band that lists members who are no longer active as """"members"""" and not """"former members"""". I would also challenge you to find a band (other than the beatles, which I agree I don't like that format) that is inactive that doesn't list it's members as """"former members"""". Perhaps a good comparison would be the band [ORG]. On their page only [PERSON], [PERSON], and and [PERSON] are listed, even though [PERSON] still own rights to aspects of the band like [PERSON] does to [PERSON]. Also, INXS does not list [PERSON] as a member. Why? Because he's deceased, as it clearly states on the page. I'm sure his estate receives royalty payments. I would argue that the problem we are having is that some folks are simply unwilling to acknowledge the fact that [PERSON] exists without [PERSON], but I could be wrong. What's frustrating is to see that this article, which was once a featured article, deviates from the norm in more than one respect in regards to this section. 1 - it lists current members of a band that is inactive (I'd be willing to have that discussion), and 2 - even if we determine that the band is active, it lists a member who is no longer playing witht the band, and a member who is deceased. Proper form would dictate that neither of these persons should be listed. """

Lastly, please note that if the page does get deleted, you can contact one of these admins to request that they userfy the page or have a copy emailed to you. Additionally if you would like to have someone review articles you create before they go live so they are not nominated for deletion shortly after you post them, allow me to suggest the article creation process and using our search feature to find related information we already have in the encyclopedia.

Ironically, this issue was addressed in another section above, with one of the editors concluding that the fame of [PERSON] alone would not suffice to make the comparison noteworthy. Another editor (or perhaps it was the same) then suggested that it might be noteworthy if it involved some sort of legal analysis. The parties seemed to agree but then - inexplicably - left it in without explaining how [PERSON]'s comparison amounts to a legal analysis. Exactly how does [PERSON]'s statement that the case would go down in history as one of the worst SCOTUS cases along with [PERSON] amount to any sort of legal analysis? With all due respect, I would argue that this is nothing but a conclusory assertion unsupported by any sound legal reasoning and should not be included in the article. If others want to leave it in, fine, but they should realize that this will open up the flood gates for including virtually any other opinion of a famous person regardless of how unsubstantiated it may be.

All of the experts in [ORG] linguistics are against the reconstructed pronunciation of ancient Greek since they make it perfectly clear that ancient Greek was pronounced like modern Greek at the time the Septuagint was translated from the original Hebrew in 280 [ORG]. This therefore implies that classical Greek must have been pronounced like modern Greek as well otherwise 72 Hebrew expert who were taught ancient Greek as children 50 years earlier would not have associated the proto-Semitic fricative gimel in [GPE] which was no longer used in the written language but was only spoken as a breath with the Greek letter gamma. Gamma therefore must have been fricative and there a myriads of other examples that [ORG] linguists use to show that ancient Greek was pronounced like modern Greek and that the Hebrew alphabet represented the mediae and dasea and z as fricatives. It is clear from the study of [ORG] linguistics and from experts in the filed like Caragounis and [GPE] that the reconstructed pronunciation is a racist sham based on [GPE] supremacy (as can be seen from the slurs in the papers of is original creators) and an affront to science and the only reason why it is still being tangut is for ethnocentric reasons alone."

They clearly separate this topic from that of human subject research in [GPE] in general.

They exist for the same reason that this one should exist numerous high-quality reliable sources have identified these topics as worthy of study in themselves. A wide array of reliable sources have identified this article's topic as worthy of standing alone as an object of analysis, separate from the broader history of human subject research in general. Per WP:NOTABLE that means that the topic of this article is worth of its own article. Just because many of the experiments in this article are things that most people would consider """"bad"""" (which is why most medical ethics textbooks generally use them as illustrations of """"bad science"""") does not mean that it is """"biased"""" to have an article on them. WP:[GPE] does not say that articles can't be about """"bad things"""". It says that we should neutrally report what reliable sources have to say about things, regardless of our moral/ethical views on them. This article neutrally reports what medical ethics texts, and histories of this topic have to say about it.

5d5d2aa641572b41,0,0,0,0,0,0,"DrPrinceton [ORG] is the top place where new computer projects are created and discussed by computer programmers. Anything that isn't right gets corrected pretty fast. For over two years the [ORG] speed test which is open source has had not one person question the results and since it is open source anyone can download the core of Python a major new computer language and run [ORG] and test all the various prime algorithms. Every algorithm lost to the ancient sieve of [GPE], every one but Prime Spirals. Now, outside of that real world test, the average mathematician or computer programmer is pretty much clueless as to primes and how they really interact in the modern world today (ie. Cryptology). Now I could have used a ton of links to [GPE] and alternative sites where for 20 years you have various groups arguing what this new algorithm means for the world. In fact much of the original argument was erased from Usenet in the 1990's, and the only group that could have done that was the [ORG]. Since the original algorithm was released when the [ORG] still controlled encryption related publishing (original paper was 1995) NO PUBLISHING COMPANY would have touched anything claiming to be how this algorithm made all encryption OBSOLETE, that was the original paper, saying to the world in 1995, here world, here is where every prime number above 5 MUST BE, there are only 8 [ORG], now your whole concept of encryption has been DESTROYED by this work. So, this prime algorthm was tied to national security issues in 1995, and in 1995 the [ORG] had a headlock on all academic publishing and guess what they still do today, who funds the [ORG] and the top journals? THE [ORG] Now my original article didn't go this deep into why in 1995, this work could not be published in academia due to the [ORG] chokehold on academic publishing for anything that could possibly be used to create new encryption or damage old encryption. Now 99.99% of the world is clueless that PRIMES are a big deal in crypto. A HUGE DEAL So understanding where they all exist and on what spirals they exist, you can now do neat tricks, like create huge seed keys for [ORG] crypto that gives the person that creates such a seed key a backdoor to that crypto, oh no, now we're talking about the heart of the issue WIKI LEAKS is all about crypto and how the [ORG] has a special skeleton key to the seed keys released by [ORG] projects like NIST and [ORG] (europes equivalent). Now in 1995 to 1999 or so this was discussed in many thousands of pages all over usenet, try to find them now, most are gone, now I actually participated in that era in some usenet discussions about the [ORG] paper, you cannot find one thread now mentioning ENNISA from the 1990's. So erased all the discussion in math and physics groups about ENNISA? Yet, if you really know where to look, you can find some references to the work, not ENNISA but the person's name and some of the the actual math still exists. Now, the math is in books, who published the books, the guy that released it has his own publishing company and it was done via ebooks. So I have a copy of the ebook. I know it's real. Now today you have academics taking credit for bits and pieces of his work, and they are 100% controlled sock puppets of the [ORG]. So the [ORG] is now controlling what the public learns about this discovery 20 years after the fact it was released via usenet. One of the new algorithms is the [PERSON] sieve, look who published it with [PERSON], the guy that sued [ORG] in the 1990's to allow software to be published without interference of the [ORG]. Look at the guys wiki page, he was tutored by the guy that actually created [ORG], the stuff the [ORG] is using to backdoor all encryption today. So 1995, the guy is suing the US Gov and 10 years later he is at [ORG] as the co-author of one of the 3 prime algorithms discussed in [ORG] in 1995. Just google NSA and [ORG], see all the [ORG] funding. Just like when academics rebelled in the 1980's against the stranglehold the [ORG] had on crypto, guess what the [ORG] did, they bought out all of academia with grants. Now I'm not a tin foil hat guy/girl, I'm retired, I was in academia and I can actually discuss stuff about math and how academia works and how various topics were taboo in the 1970's through the 1990's. So [ORG], etc, all are now in bed with grants and funding from the [ORG].

It would be difficult to confirm his educational qualification given that the person pretends to be rustic in public. As per [ORG] records his name as Lalu Prasad the issue has been discussed above.

I think the article is not at all partial to [ORG] and at the same time need further improvement.

f3b23ba92c63f788,0,0,0,0,0,0,""" Thanks! for the *. [ORG] (talk) My pleasure. I think I have to apologize for subjecting you to the diatribe it engendered but, as I think you might agree, it tends to prove the point in an ironic way. I just looked at your talk page and decided that the minor whining *I* get from new page patrol is relatively polite compared to what you seem to have attracted hence the *. Accounting4Taste:talk [ORG], you deleted my article while I was still writing it on the basis that it contained """"no references whatsoever"""" but allow your own article to stand even though it contains """"no references whatsoever"""". Please, please explain how your point been proven in """"an ironic way"""". Go ahead. Explain it. All I have seen so far from you is reckless deletion of other people`s work followed by pathetic back-slapping from like-minded wreckers. If you are going to have a dig at me, why not do it on my own talk page? You weren`t shy to destroy four hours of my work, so why be shy now? [PERSON] (talk) I think you've confused the two of us; I must take credit for some statements that have apparently offended you, having signed them, so feel free to express yourself here about them. If you want the contents of an article that was deleted, in order to work on adding citations in a """"sandbox"""" page, you can either ask me or another administrator for assistance. If you have any other questions about [ORG] policies, I'll be happy to direct you to the relevant pages. And if you'd like to work on contributing to [ORG] in a worthwhile way, in accordance with our policies, I think everyone here will try to assist you. Accounting4Taste:talk No, I haven`t confused anything. There is not very much to confuse between you two drones anyway. I see that you are not very good at answering specific questions about specific articles. Evidently, you feel much safer describing deleted articles that you have not even read as """"steaming crap"""" than you are actually discussing the actual merits of said articles. A really positive, worthwhile contribution there. Is that the kind of """"contribution"""" you want me to make? Hardly surprising that you prefer the classic politburo repsonse of """"directing me to the relevant"""" regulations rather than discuss the merits of the case in question. Yet you have the arch hypocrisy to highlight the """"assume good faith"""" legend on your page. Well I do have some questions about wikipedia policy, as you mention it: 1) Is it an acceptable practice for a wikipedia adminstrator to delete articles which are in the very process of being written without consultation or clarification on the basis that they do not contain references when the very same administrator has himself posted less relevant articles which do not contain references himself? 2) If the answer to the above is yes (and I have to conclude that it is, as that is precisely what has happened) would it be fair to conclude that wikipedia administrators feel themselves above and not subject to the same criteria for notability and verification as non-administrators? After all, my article contained no references and was deleted. NawlinWiki`s contained no references and was amended when I pointed it out. Please refer me to the relevant pages. [PERSON] (talk) 1. Yes, to the first part of the question; administrators can delete articles without consultation or clarification. Articles that are being considered for deletion are assessed entirely on their own terms, and not with reference to any other article, so comparison of your article (which I have read) with any article created or edited by anyone else is not a relevant consideration. You can read the relevant policy at WP:WAX. Well I didn`t expect you to be so candid about it. So you believe that it is entirely acceptable for an administrator to completely ignore the very regulations that he is so dogmatically enforcing onto others. You still haven`t referred me to the """"relevant"""" page on that one. But no, you have not """"read"""" my article because it was in the very process of being written when it was deleted. I am sure that there was a great deal of improvement that it required. There were some slightly whimiscial and humourous details which were possibly not appropriate for a wikipedia entry. It wasn`t perfect. You see, that is why I was editing it and indeed still writing it. Of course, in reality we know that you have not actually expressed your own opinion. You were pretty forward with your opinion the other day though, weren`t you? You described other people`s articles as """"steaming shit"""". Now though, you are not quite so forward with your opinion. Instead, you try to retreat behind """"guidelines"""" """"r"

I think I wanted to make more precise a previous editor's mention of """"the E-Meter used by [ORG]"""" in the Bioresonance therapy article - and so I found the citation which I added, and which as it stands appears to link [PERSON] (rather than bioresonance therapy itself) with [ORG]. That """"factoid"""" might live more comfortably on a [GPE] entry for [ORG], but no such article exists... though the article referenced: http://www.abi-ev.de/pdf/in141103.pdf does provide more detail.

If the referenced article http://www.abi-ev.de/pdf/in141103.pdf does indeed have methodological deficiencies, we can change our article to state that """"[ORG] allegedly had links with [ORG]'...) A very rough translation of the cited article http://www.abi-ev.de/pdf/in141103.pdf - based loosely on the translation provided in [ORG], looks something like this: [ORG], Old Poststr. 5, 70173 Stuttgart, [PERSON] .: 0711/2270074 and 0711/22021643, Fax: 0711/22021640, e-mail: [EMAIL] November 14, 2003 III / Dr.[PERSON] Scientology and Bioresonance Therapy Bioresonance Therapy includes the """"alternative"""" treatment of diseases such as allergies, eczema and asthma and in """"alternative"""" dental treatment an ever broader space. Bioresonance therapy goes back to an alleged discovery of the in the Year 1990 deceased [GPE] Doctor and senior Scientologist Dr. [PERSON]. Dr. [PERSON] had in the 70s of the 20th century the allegedly """"genius idea"""" of eliminating patients' harmful mood-swings by reflecting them . [Footnote 1: Dr. [PERSON] in a """"MORA Patient information"""" document published by [ORG] health center Wadern Elvi Foss - http://www.degezet.de/leistung.htm ] Together with his [ORG], [ORG] developed in the year 1977 the so-called MORA-therapy and MORA gear necessary for the therapy. In just this period of time Dr. [PERSON] was a [ORG] activist. So founded Dr. [PERSON] on the 12th June 1970 together with six other like-minded people in [GPE] the Club """"College for Applied Philosophy e.V."""". According to the at-the-time built [GPE], the [ORG] should exclusively serve """"scientific and research-supporting ends"""" and organize 'Courses for the enhancement of consciousness by practical application of the philosophy of [PERSON], known under the name Scientology"""". [PERSON] from that, Dr. [PERSON] co-operated in the year 1975 on the foundation of [ORG] """"Narconon"""" in [GPE]. Likewise in the Year 1975 was Dr. [PERSON] in the by [ORG] branch issued [ORG] 11 referred to as """"for years highly trained Scientologist"""". Dr. [PERSON] was, when he made public his method of treatment, since many years an active Scientologist, who openly held [PERSON] teaching and techniques as an appropriate basis for scientific and educational activity. Under the given conditions it appears not surprising that the idea of bioresonance therapy shows parallels to Scientology practices including: While supporters of Bioresonance therapy believe appropriate equipment can catch harmful moodswings of people and by the generation of corresponding counter-vibrations can weaken or delete them, Scientologists see in so-called engrams a type of spiritual disruption fields, which with Scientology auditing with the help of the bioresonance devices - quite similar to the so-called E-Meter (electric meter) - can be tracked and deleted. The MORA-Gerät is still distributed by [ORG] in [PERSON]. [PERSON] is Managing Director of [ORG]. In view of the social and family Relations between Dr. [PERSON] and Mr. [PERSON] one can hardly assume that the activities of the late [ORG] remained hidden to Mr. [PERSON]. The Term """"Bioresonanztherapie"""" was according to [ORG] in [GPE] coined by its own executive director [PERSON]. The firm [ORG] markets a therapeutic device comparable to the MORA-gear, called [ORG], which in the words of [PERSON] originated """"in collaboration with Dr. [PERSON]"""". The two Managing Directors of [ORG] and [PERSON] - have been Scientologists for many"

I made analogies between admin behavior and classical abuse of power. I was personally attacked. No admins have been blocked. I was not trolling.

At least one admin thinks my being called a troll is enough evidence, because now I am blocked. (And I seriously doubt any admin is reading this page). I was not disrupting anything and I am not posting in any inappropriate manner. I was discussing the problem in the forum provided.

5af8fa7f5f5417ef,0,0,0,0,0,0,""":Let me first of all set the record straight about the history of the relationship between myself and User:Jza84. On his talk page Jza84 states 'I hardly know the editor bar an passing in a discussion from time to time'. As [PERSON] notes on that same page, '[PERSON] clearly knows [ORG] is a long-time established editor here; [PERSON] interacted with [ORG] as early as November 2007, over 6 months before [PERSON] became an admin.' That interaction was courteous and constructive and repeated on a number of occasions. I wouldn't claim that we were regular collaborators, but collaborate we did, and if somebody had aske me, before this incident, 'do you know this editor and do you have a good working relationship with him?' I would have replied in the affirmative, without hesitation. The only real """"edit conflict"""" I had with him prior to this was in February of this year, at British Day. This was resolved civilly and without rancour, although I have to admit that I found his attitude at the time patronising - """"A lesson would be it took all of five minutes to strengthen the article up with a few references."""" - and felt that the zealousy with which he reacted to my edits - an effort to bring balance to a biased account, in my opinion, for what it's worth - whilst ignoring a number of dubious and unsourced statements and peacock terms for the opposing view of the subject, was unbalanced. However, I refrained from comment (see Brit Day in his talk page archive). 'Everybody is entitled to their views', I said to myself, and moved on. I'll admit that I tended to avoid him after that as I had no wish to get embroiled in anything: I've got better things to do. I could have responded to this comment on Talk:Newport which I found to be deeply insulting to all [PERSON] people: saying that [PERSON] was 'an advocate of """"Welsh nationality"""" (which doesn't exist, verifiabily)(). That statement left me with the indelible impression that Jza84 denied the nationality of myself and all [PERSON] people. I thought that was a very hurtful comment and completely unnecessary and I am sure that most [PERSON] people would feel the same way. However, once again I did not respond even though I was part of that discussion and was sorely tempted to do so: '[PERSON] it', I told myself. Shortly later I became aware of a series of edits by Jza84 removing Welsh nationality and replacing it with 'British' on a number of articles on my watchlist; amongst them was the article on [PERSON], [PERSON] senior statesman. Rightly or wrongly, I was by then convinced that Jza84 had a personal agenda on this matter. I reverted some edits and ignored others not on my watchlist as I genuinely did not want to get involved in a dispute (and no, it had nothing to do with his admin status). However, when I saw his edit to Template:Welsh kingdoms, also on my watchlist, I will admit that I was incensed. I reacted with less tact than I should have done, I admit. I reverted his edit. Changing 'Welsh kingdoms' to the woefully incorrect and insulting 'Brittonic petty kingdoms of [GPE]' seemed to me to confirm my impression of him: it basically de-Cymricised the major kingdoms of medieval [ORG], which have a central place in our history and identity, used a term which is both incorrect and open to misinterpretation by the general reader (not everyone is aware of the meaning of the rather obsolete and affected term 'petty kingdom'). He than undid my edit and came up with the wording 'Ancient kingdoms of [GPE]', which is again quite simply incorrect ('medieval' is not 'ancient'). Then I read his """"explanation"""" on the talk page. Quite frankly I thought he was taking the mickey. It also confirmed me in my opinion that he had an agenda of denying the [PERSON] people their identity (quote: 'What exactly are the [PERSON] kingdoms? Kingdoms inhabited by the [PERSON]? Well, no, the Welsh are a modern nation who live in [GPE]. Are they subdivisions of [GPE]? Well, also no, these kingdoms pre-date [GPE] by centuries ([ORG] was a concept of the future!'). 'What fools historians, [PERSON] and others, have been to refer to such icons of [PERSON] history as [PERSON] (and his court poets who praised him as 'King of the Welsh' etc.)', I said to myself. At that point I should have taken a deep breath and walked away to make a coffee, count to several thousand and then respond. But I did not, and the result is this. That sets the record straight. I've already apologised for any offense I may have caused and given my opinion of Jza84's decision. I write this to let my peers who have commented and acted on the matter get the 'history' behind this incident from my point of view. I do not intend to respond here to other things which have been said or implied here and at Jza84's page about"

89de6be1edabd915,1,0,0,0,0,0,"I'm going to be honest with you, I'm not going to pass your articles as [ORG], because frankly, they suck. But that doesn't mean an agreement can't be reached upon where your articles could still potentially reach GA. First thing you need to know, is that Good Article status is a crock of shit. The criteria for it is a fair model, and it is not the problem. The problem is that it is not governed by a committee. Any bozo, like yourself, is allowed to review an article and ultimately decide if the article, in their mind, merits inclusion into [ORG] (Club [PERSON]). The bar sits firmly in the mud. Snakes slither across it. My articles, on the other hand, never have enjoyed the benefits of exception. With extreme prejudice, they have been held to the highest possible standard set by the criteria. Now we get to your GA review of [GPE], which I would like a full explanation for. That's one of the agreements that I have set forth, in order for you to avoid failure of your articles, by me. You can decide if you would like to abide by this resolution or not. Tell me something, are you on drugs, prescription or otherwise? If that offends you I apologize, but your review made me think of three things. Either somebody took a shit on your face and you couldn't see through it, you had a big D in your ass, or you were in a state of incoherence brought on by substance abuse. I must confess, I'm ashamed that I'm even having to talk to some punk ass high school kid who listens to crappy music. Not that I feel that I hold a higher place in this world than you, because Lord knows that's not the case. It's just that, I'm sittin' here having to deal with some goddamn little kid over the computer. Even at your age, I know you understand where I'm coming from. There's not much of a reward getting an article to GA status, aside from that dot. A small part of me would like to see the article at [ORG], but it really doesn't concern me a whole lot whether it gets there or not. [PERSON] is at GA and that's basically good enough for me. As far as Halfway Gone goes, at this point, it's outta my hands. You're just gonna have to accept the fact the article could possibly be de-listed. Consider that your penalty for fuckin' around with other people's hard work. Ok, so there are two agreements I have come up with that I think are very acceptable. A full explanation of your GA review of [FAC] (album). I'll guide you through it on the review page. If you decide to play ball, good on ya. You must say the following to me, here on my talk page: I, , am just a punk ass teenager, who loves [PERSON], loves the crappy music of [PERSON], and loves crappy music from many other crappy artists. The font has to be huge too, none of this small crap. Also, see if you can do it in some kind of color, that would be cool. Now, I will not pass your articles if you agree to this, but I will not fail them. Instead, I will explain on the review pages that any reviewing of the articles that I have done up until this point should be disregarded. My reasoning will be because of my inexperience as a first time reviewer has led me to realize that I am not capable for such a task. I will wash my hands of the articles, take them off hold, and request that another editor undertake the review. If you are unwilling to accept these agreements, than you leave me no other choice but to expeditiously fail the articles. Let me know what you wanna do kid. (meow)"

Only a very few atoms (helium, neon, and argon) have [ORG] filled electron shells, and can participate in energy-releasing fusion.

It does not need to say HOW filled an electron shell is, when making generic remarks about light nuclei.

I recall reading about the shells being in the way about 4 decades ago, when I first started learning stuff about fusion. It was the very first thing that came to my mind, as a problem to solve, when I first heard about cold fusion. It is silly to not mention this problem in the article here. IS there a conspiracy by CF-detractors, to keep any data out of the article that might someday become related used to the solutions to the main problems? Why else would Art do his latest lie-of-omission, trying to talk about real nuclei under real-world conditions without paying any attention to the electrons that were associated with those nuclei?

A pilot of free-text detection software in 5 [GPE] institutions 4. A good practice guide to plagiarism detection A listserv has also been to continue discussions dealing with academic dishonest and plagiarism issues. A copy of [ORG] can be accessed at http://www.turnitin.com/static/pdf/luton.pdf. . JISC Plagiarism Advisory Service http://www.jiscpas.ac.uk/ JISC Plagiarism Advisory Service is a new offering that began in September 2002. It is based in [ORG] at [ORG] ([GPE]). New materials are constantly being added to this plagiarism portal, but it currently offers advice & guidance, educational materials for students and other online resources. A plagiarism detection service, supported by [ORG] (JISC) until August 2004, is based on the turnitin.com platform and allows instructors to conduct electronic comparisons of work complete by students. [ORG] https://www.ipd.uni-karlsruhe.de/jplag/ [PERSON] initially developed this software which is designed to detect academic dishonesty. The software does more than merely compare the text of documents. [ORG] also looks at program language syntax and program structure so it can also be used to detect stolen software parts. Instructors may use [ORG] for free, but they must first set up an account in order to prevent unauthorized use by students. Library Electronic Databases http://www.library.uiuc.edu/orr/ The Library at [ORG] provides access to numerous electronic resources for students and faculty. Instructors may want to consult these resources when checking for plagiarism. Full text databases like [ORG] and [ORG] (InfoTrac) are two obvious starting points when checking undergraduate assignments. One thing to keep in mind is that some resources that are not full text but provide abstract information are often used by students. Moss http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~aiken/moss.html Moss or Measure of Software Similarity is a tool that has been used primarily to detect plagiarism. The way it works is that it detects similarities of C, [PERSON], [PERSON], [PERSON], [GPE], [ORG], Lisp or Scheme programs. Moss is free to use for instructors and staff of programming language courses only. [ORG] http://www.plagiarism.org [ORG] students and alumni created plagiarism.org to be used to detect plagiarism. One thing to watch out for is that the software doesn't differentiate between quoted materials and original writing. [ORG] http://www.plagiarism.phys.virginia.edu/ [PERSON], [ORG] at [ORG], is the sole author of [ORG]. The goal of this site is to """"help reduce the impact of plagiarism on education and educational institutions"""". Numerous links are provided to sources on how to deal with plagiarism. [ORG] http://www.turnitin.com/ [ORG], a plagiarism.org partner, considers themselves to be """"the world's most widely recognized and trusted resource for helping prevent Internet plagiarism"""". Free trials are also available, and subscription costs vary depending on the type of plan chosen. [ORG] is currently the subject of a copyright controversy.

Also, you ended by writing that """" it's clear you aren't a journalist, and have no means of carrying out your threat """" - LOL. Sad, that you lived in that illusion. For JOKERS like you who are totally idle,and who scribble away in virtual pages on Wiki-scribble-pedia, will obviously withdraw from the truth. You yourself have no idea at all if I am a journalist, and you write that it's clear that I am not. Well, you are also inane and a clown to fool yourself. I had all means, and the said article has already been published. I had NO TIME to let you know, since I am a busy person, unlike you and do not find time to come scribble on virtual pages that clowns like you , 2OVERO, 2/0, [ORG], [ORG], FISHERQUEEN (yeah, we named you again - Suck it up), [ORG] etc. do all your life.

Nobody denied that people feel shame about masturbating, but medically and psychologically seen masturbation is healthy and perfectly normal.

You might ponder that not only sex therapists (which you more or less called them perverts) agree on this, but MDs in general and psychologists in general (although consensus isn't unanimity, so there may be some fringe MDs and psychologists who hold weird views about masturbation). E.g. I have searched the whole DSM-IV-TR for the keyword masturbation and nowhere is it considered a disease. It is considered problematic only when done in public, overtly or when it leads to other health problems, such as encopresis (when produced by anal masturbation).

Here are some suggestions/comments for improvement: The references are a mess. None of them are formatted properly and several of them (IMDb, scifipedia, hunkymalecelebs) are not from reliable sources. I suggest using citation templates in order to correctly format the links and look for replacement refs for those from disreputable sources. (habla conmigo) Two fansites are linked to in the external links. Per WP:EL, there should be none. Also remove the duplicate IMDb link to the awards and nominations page; this is redundant. :Image:Han2.jpg does not have a fair use rationale. The use of """"influential"""" in the lead, although sourced, is open to debate. I would remove it entirely. More information needs to be given in order for the lead to adhere to WP:LEAD; there is no mention of his early life, music training, family, or cult following.

e117882af82faa43,0,0,0,0,0,0,""" [ORG] to Earlier Morality Accusation This is inresponse to a cowardly """"unsigned"""" who suggested that [PERSON] was a pedophile. The entire section was deleted. I think the response is worth keeping as it delves into the intrigue in [GPE]'s life. """"Isn't the [GPE] age of consent 18?""""-(as """"unsigned"""" stated). Hey [PERSON], this was the NINETEENTH CENTURY!!! Thoughout the western world, females marrying at the age of 16 were common. Never raising as much as an eyebrow from the emerging Victoian era. Actually, a young girl marrying a man who was middle-aged and still in the prime of life was applauded AND encouraged, as well as her parents for matching her with any man who had established means. What was frowned upon at that time (and still very-much today,)was if the man were eighteen to her, say sixteen, or both were the same teen age (Though today, as was true then, a parent could get a waiver, and consent to the union). A young marriage was mightily discouraged by society AND the girl's parents in that bygone era, as they saw """"young love"""" as impetuous, irrational, and especially IMMATURE. Unless the man was shown to be of more than sufficient means, maturity and responsibility; that he came from a respected family, the whole idea was nixed. Also, remember that arranged marriages were still quite common in turn-of-the-century [GPE]. (And too, fathers were eager to get their daughters """"married off"""" as soon as possible, so they wouldn't get """"radical"""" ideas of """"independence"""" floating in their heads.) Not like the """"mail-order brides"""" of the rambling Old West! (Actually, would it surprise you that arranged unions are still widely carried out today accross every interested section and spectrum of society in the West. It's just more informal, as the female [ORG] is tasked by parents and relatives to choose a mate within the liking of the parents, and often-times, relatives. """"Gotta please Mom and Dad, my grandparents AND priest, ya know?"""" You should also study more about [ORG]'s life before making moronic and scurrilous accusations. If you did delve further, you would find that [ORG]'s second marriage was more a """"politcal"""" arrangement than anything else, as little [PERSON] was a neice of [PERSON] principal enemy and competitor [PERSON]. Struggling as the latter was to keep his floundering gas-light industry afloat against the inevitability of the electric street lamp. So, the marrige was a very strategically diabolic """"investment"""" on [ORG]'s part to overtake [ORG]' business, which eventually happened. (We are reminded that [ORG] a a [ORG] BARON: This is what they do.)It is strange that you'd call [ORG] a pedophile. Why, unless you seek to marr his reputation? |talk]]) Veryverser Following this clarification, perhaps it was the article's author who attempted to resolve this by offering the results of his """"genelogical study"""" of what was conventional in such relationships in that period that [ORG] lived. This I felt was inadequate, so I countered with... We are talking SOCIAL CONVENTIONS here, of course. Naturally long before the 1960sA.D. """"women's liberation"""", all females needed their parents or guardian(s)'s consent, whether they were co-habitating with them, or the women were apart from them and\or had indepenent means. This was common all over the world, with this tradition being broken, beginingin in [LOC] by enforced emigration(for example)of Irish and other European refugees in the nineteenth, and then again in the early twentieth centuries. Even women who were twenty-one years old in the turn-of-the nineteenth, and early twentieth century's """"middle-class"""" strata were required to seek a respectable, well-heeled sponsor, to give consent to a bethrotal if these females ever were to hope to enter what was then regarded as """"respectable"""" society"""". This all seemed to chagge in [GPE] after World War I, as there seemed to have been a definite """"cultural shift"""", throwing-off those old traditions of a previous generation and epoch. [PERSON]'s age difference is a non-issue. Even in most parts of [LOC] and [LOC] today, age in a marriage of an older man to a (well, sometimes much) younger woman is revered. Here, in the [GPE], various wealthly and powerful men, among them old [GPE] and media types flaunt their marriage to virtual child-[PERSON], [PERSON] as obvious examples. Curious-wouldn't you agree-that in both cases cited, these men chose YOUNG, [ORG], rather than western ones for their """"sunset years""""). In [ORG] case, this was sort of a """"wirlwind romance"""" manipulated by the girl's uncle, as I cited above, to get at [ORG] and control of his company. Think [PERSON] divorce of [PERSON] to marry a Hapsburgh princess, and the world-shattering events that ensued from such a """"political"""" union. Special:Contr"

Why? Instead you are pushing for a blog post which is absolute nonsense. You are adding a two piece article which is a one sided attack on me, [PERSON]. I have never had a 'dispute' with [PERSON], since I have not contacted him, as he claimed in the article published by [ORG]. They also published other lies, which since have been removed due to my protest and conversation with their attorney. Please edit in good faith and stick to the truth. I will file a protest with [ORG], because what is happening is a continuation of the planned out in detail slander, character defamation and assassination by a small group of people who are obviously connected to and behind the fraud crimes, the criminal hoaxes which we exposed and debunked. This article is literally a stage for book projects such as June DiMaggio's and [PERSON]. Maybe the time has come that we must also expose the real person behind Delicious carbuncle?! Again, I knew that I would become the target of the criminals who I stopped screwing over the general public with their gimmicks, attached to the legacy of [PERSON]. But I will use my clear and given right to defend what we, three people who did care and worked for this for the past three years have achieved and succeeded with. The [ORG] articles must be added to this article, and the [ORG] is a dead blog, which was a favor/favour posted by a friend, this is how this lady introduced herself to me on the phone when she called me up, of [PERSON], the friend and manager of the June DiMaggio book project. She quoted me out of context and she admitted to me that she is NOT a press agency or journalist. Regarding the [PERSON] claims which you willingly added. I have never spoken to [PERSON], ever since I was introduced to him and his mother in 2005. He followed me to every blog, every website. Attacked us, hidden behind monikers. What is happening here right now is an example of some bias people who have created this to destroy our credibility. It is a sad act of cutting off our freedom of speech and also trying to diminish our success in terms of the fraud exposures. Who is behind this? We do know exactly who is and we already have taken action. And that exposure is way more interesting than anything we have taken on in the past. It has also to do with cyber bullying, since I am being portrayed as a monster. I am being compared to [PERSON] and [PERSON] and that website was posted anonymously in [GPE]. These people want me to go the [ORG] Meier way. They have already told me to kill myself. Not once, but twice. They have called me a 'pedophile' and other insults. They have claimed that I made bomb threats when I have never ever threatened anyone. At all. I have never extorted anyone. You people, hiding behind your funny and also so believable names, you know why you are doing this and why you are using [GPE], to destroy my name, completely. When I protested on the 45th anniversary of [PERSON] death, outside the chapel, I had my reason. Three people were threatened and harassed by the 'Monroe 6 Version 2007' gang of people who threatened me to 'come to my home, tie me on a chair, duct tape me and steal my collection. They were not shy to even include the AIDS infected blood by one of the members. One of the people who is part of this group is now hiding behind this [GPE] moniker and we positively have received confirmation, that this female from [GPE], a woman which I have never met in personis part of this gang of super obsessive fans who on top of this also have created, have thought out these many frauds, hoaxes, crimes. I am asking you, that if you decide to keep this site up and going, NOT to use it to destroy our success in terms of our exposures. I never thought that the power of blog could bring down the biggest exhibition fraud in history, but it did. [ORG], so simple created and achieved naturally delivers a lot of haters. Jealousy is one thing, but facts and achievements are another. It is one thing to post hateful comments about someone and to claim that '[PERSON] mentally ill' and other worse things, and to post these hater attacks with monikers such as all of these people do itin known [PERSON] manner. But it is unfair and it is also liable to post lies on a website, which is nothing else than the revenge of a group"

6a4fe95208e91966,0,0,0,0,0,0,"I'm not clear whether a picture of a child's genitalia is legitimate or not - you appear to be more familiar with the way it works than me; perhaps you should ask whether images of children's genitalia are acceptable on [GPE]. I object to it for several reasons. The is first that it is an image of a child's genitalia (albeit deceased), which is not usually accepted online for non-intersex children, and I am not sure why intersex childrens' genitals should be an exception to this. Second, the example in question is quite an extreme case, where the child had a number of complications which meant it did not survive, and the genital ambiguity was one aspect of those complications. I would worry that people seeking information and support would find this paper quite shocking, and as you are no doubt aware, it is an extremely rare case which has limited bearing on the experiences of the majority of intersex people. So, is it a representative image (and link) on intersex? No, it is not. So, why is it there? Finally, I resist the reduction of intersex issues to simply being about genital ambiguity - just as I resist the reduction to [ORG]/XX chromosomes and all that entails. I am sure that there would be better, fully consensual, images available if required - although I am not sure why they are necessary. People who are involved with intersex in some way will not find it informative or helpful, so the only purpose appears to be either for 'shock' value or voyeurism, neither of which seem valid reasons for having the picture on [GPE]."

6e019e391650cfcc,1,0,0,0,0,0,"Honestly the way wiki is treating this is a JOKE a. I could have cited NEWS SITES but since when is a news site worthy of an academic cite? b. if the person that wanted PEER REVIEW felt like it, he would have sought it 20 years ago, HE CHOSE NOT TO DO IT, but none the less his work is known and was mentioned in many math related 'forums' and most ignored it. c. Only the recent 2012 open source test of the work PROVED the 30Mod algorithm is a major thing in math, again, [ORG] is a programmers resource and it was not until a computer used the actual 30Mod algorithm that it was shown to be a 'big thing' and since then some news sites have covered it, but I chose not to cite them due to IMO they are not [GPE]. But none the less they covered the story. d. The [ORG] is a major computer site where programmers have free reign to challenge any claims exists and for over two years not one programmer challenged the findings. e. so what if the person that discovered it works outside of academia and has no regard for normal 'peer review' the fact is he has no peers if you ask some in academia that know of his work, and I am one of those people that know of the work and how brilliant the work is. Now to summarize, we have a bunch of pags about primes on wiki, and even pages created after his discovery that USE his discovery (ie. the sieve of [FAC] work is his work discussed in the public forum and usenet math and physics forums is where he chose to discuss his amazing work. So now you have 2004 sieve of [GPE] using a 60Mod algorithm, guess what that was in his 1995 paper. So does wiki acknowledge that? No. And i didn't even bother to waste my time of the 60 mod algorithm since the big deal as you are saying is the [ORG] test and I cited that very well, it's a program created in [GPE], I cited the wiki python page, then I cited [GPE] for both [PERSON] and the [ORG] testing. Now while MATH is m forte, I am sufficient enough in computer skills to understand what [PERSON] is and to understand how to read the speed tests and the prime spirals smoked every algorithm there is. Now anyone can download python (which I have done) and download pyprimes (which I have done) and run the tests. Guess what just like a math experiment, it is duplicated. So [ORG] and the tests which are not 'new' should be enough to begin a wiki page on this truly amazing discovery in math. I myself became aware of the first paper in 1995, as did others in aademia. Recently I became aware of 'news sites' running stories citing what I copied, the links to the [PERSON] tests. While some here can say well it's not [ORG], so what, in the world of primality testing primes spirals as per the [ORG] results shows PRIME [ORG] are a big deal. Now I tried to be [GPE] in giving all sides of the story, [PERSON] has a valid 1995 claim I can verify it and I chose not to. But I cited a [ORG] Math forum and I could have cited many other math sites discussing his 30mod, 60mod and 90mod prime work in the 1990's. Is this signficant? You bet it is since 60Mod prime sieve aka [PERSON] sieve is 20004 so his 60mod prime work is well before it. Now the Github tests mentions 'croft spirals', that's due to in 2010 a person named croft registering a web site and ripping off the 1995 work. MY OPINION. Now [PERSON] can say all he wants that he found it playng his guitar or whatever he is claiming. The fact is anyone can document [PERSON] with Prime theory from the 1990's saying 30mod, 60mod and 90mod is the key. 9 Years later sieve of atkin appears, well that's only a rehash of the adoni 60mod work from the 1990's. Yet no one is giving him credit. 2010 croft puts out his 30Mod work and its inserted into [GPE] on [GPE] and it smokes every major prime algorithm there is and all of them have pages on wiki as I cited. So 2012 a work on [GPE] verifies how important to primality the 30mod spirals are, but he says croft spirals, well guess what HelixQ is now out there and taking 100% credit for the 1995 work of Dr. [PERSON]. My site to a [ORG] math site from the 1990's mentioning 30Mod prime work (prime spirals) is a major cite, since [PERSON] could care less about the [ORG] or whatever, in all probability he will soon be nominated for a Nobel on his work, that is how important it is. Think about it, not one prime algorithm could beat the ancient sieve of [GPE], none of them. On a computer creating primes all other algorithms are terribly slow. The only two fast generators from scratch are the ancient sieve of [GPE] and the PRIME SPIRALS, and the winner was [ORG]. Now I can cite recent news articles about it, laughing at academics it links to that said it was no big deal in the 1990's who now all look foolish due"

College, [FAC], [GPE] The present study is related different geometry of the Hall thrusters in which I have tried to get better results than the simple Hall thrusters available at present with the future next generation device [PERSON] collider (DTTC) hub by the using new type of code [ORG] ([ORG]). Hall thrusters were studied independently in the [GPE] and the [GPE] in the 1950s and '60s. However, the concept of a Hall thruster was only developed into an efficient propulsion device in the former [GPE], whereas in the [GPE], scientists focused instead on developing girded ion thruster. Two types of Hall thrusters were developed in [GPE]: (A)Thruster with wide acceleration zone, [PERSON] (Russian), [ORG], (Stationary [PERSON]) at [ORG]. (B) Thruster with narrow acceleration zone, [ORG] in English: [ORG], ([GPE] with [PERSON]), at [ORG] (TsNIIMASH). Soviet and Russian SPD thrusters The common [ORG] design was largely the work of [PERSON]. [ORG] engines were operated since 1972. They were mainly used for satellite stabilization in [GPE] and in [LOC] directions. Since then until the late 1990s 118 [ORG] engines completed their mission and some 50 continued to be operated. Thrust of the first generation of SPD engines, SPD-50 and SPD-60 was 20 and 30 [ORG] respectively. In 1982 SPD-70 and SPD-100 were introduced, their thrust being 40 [ORG] and 83 mN. In the post-Soviet [GPE] high-power (a few kilowatts) SPD-140, SPD-160, [PERSON], [ORG] and low-power (less than 500 W) SPD-35 were introduced. [ORG] has a life time of 8000 hrs, efficiency of 52%.Soviet and Russian DAS-type engines include D-38 and D-55. Soviet-built thrusters were introduced to the [LOC] in 1992 after a team of electric propulsion specialists, under the support of [ORG], visited Soviet laboratories and experimentally evaluated the SPD-100 (i.e., a 100 mm diameter SPT thruster). Over 200 Hall thrusters have been flown on Soviet/Russian satellites in the past thirty years. They were used mainly for station keeping and small orbital corrections. Currently [PERSON] research, design, and theoretical modeling are led by experts at [ORG] and [ORG]. A considerable amount of development is being conducted in industry, such as [ORG] This technology was used on the European lunar mission [ORG] and is used on a number of commercial geostationary satellites. What's a Hall Thruster? The Hall thruster is a type of plasma-based propulsion systems for space vehicles. The amount of fuel that must be carried by a satellite depends on the speed with which the thruster can eject it. [ORG] rockets have very limited fuel exhaust speed. [PERSON] can be ejected at much higher speeds; therefore less fuel need be carried on board. The Hall thruster was invented in the late 1950's. Until the mid 1990's, it has been developed primarily by the Russians. During the past 30 years, the Russian placed in orbit more than 100 Hall thrusters. However, the vast majority of satellites worldwide have relied on chemical thrusters and, to a lesser extent, arc jet thrusters and ion thrusters. A conventional electrostatic ion thruster consists of two grids, an anode and a cathode, between which a voltage drop occurs. Positively charged ions accelerate away from the anode toward the cathode grid and through it. After the ions get past the cathode, electrons are added to the flow, neutralizing the output to keep it moving. A thrust is exerted on the anode-cathode system, in a direction opposite to that of the flow. Unfortunately, a positive charge builds up in the space between the grids, limiting the ion flow and, therefore, the magnitude of the thrust that can be attained. In a Hall thruster, electrons injected into a radial magnetic field neutralize the space charge. The magnitude of the applied magnetic field is approximately 100-200 gauss, strong enough to trap the electrons by causing them to spiral around the field lines in the coaxial channel. The magnetic field and a trapped electron cloud together serve as a virtual cathode. The ions, too heavy to be affected by the field, continue their journey through the virtual cathode. The movement of the positive and negative electrical charges through the system results"

May I draw to your attention that it is fairly obvious that those three users namely Seb az86556 , Seric2 and [ORG] are clearly constantly creating a picture of [GPE] as a decadent muslim city that serves their religious beliefs and are all clearly hailing form Turkish backgrounds. There is a constant undermining of the city´s Greek identity i.e. whenever a Greek flag appears in any single picture the aforementioned users delete that picture instantaneously and prefer to throw in pictures of the flag of """"shame"""" and occupation that is equivalent to a legalisation of a human crime of continuous brutal occupation of the island of [GPE] by the Turkish army. The Greek flag is [GPE] in [GPE] whether some people like it or detest it but this is the reality and an [FAC] that wishes to be [ORG] should depict the [ORG] and not the subjective views of a minority of readers that are furthermore based on extremist religious and nationalistic views. On the other hand, such users do find it appropriate to throw in pictures using the Turkish and the [ORG], yes illegal according to [ORG] referendums flat of the non-recognised internationally illegal self-proclaimed state of the so-called [ORG]. It is totally [ORG] to have extremist nationalistic individuals, that strategically reached the level of administrators, deteriorating all the time the article on the city of [GPE], promoting an unrealistic Turkish character and undermining the Greek character of the city AND at the same time having an ADDITIONAL article on """"North Nicosia"""" that is depicting a totally FALSE picture w.r.t the city. The [ORG] is illegal, not recognised by any state other than [GPE] and some terrorist states that are non-democratic and yet [ORG] has a page on [LOC] by supposedly administrators that support the unification of [GPE]. This is clearly a major distortion of their intentions and a huge lie in that an individual that pretends to be a neutral aribtrator and a supoporter of reunification cannot have a separate page on [LOC] stressing how Turkish it is and then go and literally destroy everything in the proper page for [GPE] and emphasize the Turkish character of the city, talk about the tension and the division of the city all the time and undermine the Greek character. This is clear nationalistic and racial discrimination against the indisputable Greek character of the area controlled by [GPE] and furthermore it is downgrading for [GPE] the mere fact that [ORG] has a site that is [GPE] vandalised by several ethnic Turkish extremists and [ORG] users support such discriminatory behaviour. In the light of all of this, I shall stop contributing to [ORG] as I consider it downgrading for my own self. Furthermore, I do not wish to participate in an """"encyclopedic"""" project that is totally biased and discriminatory. Marcobadotti (talk) """

The violence flared up after of several weeks of tense public debate between Maronite and Baptist clergy. More than 20 men from Ajaltoun village attacked Christ [ORG] on August 2, slashing car tires, breaking the church door and windows, stealing computer and sound equipment, beating men and groping several women. Compass Direct, Aug 22, 2006 A group of 10 Maronite men assaulted Baptist Pastor [PERSON] and another church member at 6:30 p.m. as they were on their way to retrieve items from their parked cars. The Maronites broke the unidentified church member’s rib and both men’s glasses, smashed the car windows and then dumped the two men inside before joining another group of 10 in attacking the church building. “Police were at the church watching everything,” Abou-Mekhael, 35, told [ORG]. “They even advised the attackers on what to steal and vandalize.” [ORG] said that the men were led by Ajaltoun Mayor [PERSON], who had the church officially sealed off with “red wax” immediately after the attack so that no one could enter the building. In an August 6 newspaper article entitled, “No Justification for Building a Baptist Church in a Region whose Overwhelming Majority is [PERSON],” the local Maronite bishop attacked the Baptist church’s right to exist. [PERSON] wrote in local newspapers that there were “no followers of the Baptists in [GPE],” and the “decrees of [ORG] [to which the church does not belong] prohibit building a church in areas without followers therein.” In an e-mail to [ORG], [ORG] said that the Baptist congregation had requested a permit to build a residence but had instead built a church. He declined to answer questions about whether he had been aware of plans to attack the church on August 2, but said that he had been celebrating mass at a church in the mountains when he received a telephone call alerting him to the violence. In articles published in [GPE] and [GPE] newspapers, the bishop called for the attorney general to close down the building. “This is nonsense,” said [PERSON], President of [ORG] in [GPE] and [GPE], to which the [ORG] church belongs. “We can worship in a legal church building, we can worship in an apartment and we can worship in the free air.” As a Protestant community in [GPE], “we have the full rights to build churches to worship freely in any place we choose,” Sahyouni told [PERSON]. “We do not need to get permission.” Worship Rights In his written responses to [ORG], [ORG] did not specify why it was illegal to hold church services in a home but claimed that the Baptists were violating the law by owning a printing press in the basement of their building. The bishop’s biggest complaint was that the Baptists aimed to steal Maronite members of his flock. “Why don’t the Baptists want to be part of [ORG]?” the bishop wrote, referring to an ecumenical council of Orthodox, Catholic and certain [PERSON] churches that he said forbids proselytizing each other’s members. “Don’t they support ecumenism and dialogue? If we are mistrustful of the Baptist people, it is because of their bad behavior.” The bishop did not respond to questions about whether individuals in [GPE] had the"

The point the article makes is that different names are used: popular language calls this thing """"singular they"""", linguists call it """"plural anaphoric they"""". Sure, it's the same thing. I'm not sure where you get the idea of indeterminate number """"shifting"""" to indeterminate gender. I, for one, agree with you, there is no such """"shift"""" in English (unless it lies a long way back in the history of English pronouns, but that's another, and long, story). The article, however, at least as I read it, also agrees with us. It asserts there are two types of indeterminacy, either or both of which can be marked by use of they. Where does it say one """"shifts"""" into the other? Regarding your sentences, you have constructed them such that all have indeterminate gender. The first, however, could clearly apply to 0, 1 or >=2 people, so also has indeterminate number (or is plural, per [GPE]). The key thing is that all your sentences involve universal quantification over the domain (or restriction) of a variable: for all people or students x in X, your sentences assert something that is true for person or student x. Because there is a plurality of x in X, [GPE] and other liguists, call usage of they, in constructions such as yours, plural. Because each x is a singular person (in the first sentence a hypothetical person), ordinary people, like you and me, call this usage """"singular"""". In fact, though, these constructions are distributive (one assertion to each of many people), which is why grammatical number cannot be well defined. There is no specific reference, so singularity or plurality can't be derived from a referent in the usual way. The constructions have either generic reference, or no reference at all. """

After the retreat of [PERSON] and his forces, the Muslims directed their attention towards the groups that had committed treason to the Charter of Medina.

Though outnumbered 800 to 300 in the battle, the Muslims met with success, killing at least 45 Makkans, including [PERSON], and taking 70 prisoners; whereas only 14 Muslims died. To the Muslims this appeared as a divine vindication of [PERSON]'s prophethood, and he and all the Muslims rejoiced greatly.

As the Transnistrian referendum deadline approaches, to the support for the separatists from [ORG] comes disinformation not only from press agencies, but also campaigns in the purest [ORG] style. This years June month, several publications from [GPE] and [PERSON] made a big deal about the conclusions of a certain report “made by prestigious western experts”, a report which plead for the independence of the separatist region from eastern [GPE]. The study was attributed to some institutions with pompous names: """"[ORG] (ICDISS; where [PERSON] leads) and """"Euro-Atlantic Joint Forum Contact Group"""". Among the signatures were quoted several well-known [ORG], [PERSON] or [ORG]: [PERSON], [PERSON], [PERSON], [PERSON], [PERSON], [PERSON], [PERSON], [PERSON]. These were said to have participated in April 2006, at a conference at [FAC] in [GPE], together with several other experts in international law, among which a high ranking official of [ORG]. They all concluded that “Transdniester has all the required criteria for it to be declared an independent state”, thus flagrantly contradicting the official position of all western governments. The [PERSON] reporters contacted the quoted professors. Astounded, they declared that they do not have any connection with the report mediatised in the Russian press. [PERSON], professor of international relations at [ORG] declared that he didn`t even wrote about [PERSON] ever. [PERSON], professor at [ORG], transmitted to us that the authors of the so called report had done nothing else than to copy and adapt an older study of his and of [PERSON], written over a decade ago, not about [PERSON], but about [PERSON]. [PERSON], professor an [ORG] declared: “I want to make it clear that I was not involved in the writing of this report. I suspect that the implication of the mentioned names was used to give a certain credibility to that report, and to deceive the public”. [PERSON] investigation was taken over and continued by [ORG]. After studing the text of the report, the bitish journalist concluded that despite it`s academic language, certain expressions betrayed the fact that English was not the maternal language of the authors. For example, the use of the expression """"telephone centrals"""" instead of """"exchanges"""" is a very common error found in Russian to English translations.The surprises continued. The british journalists found that at [FAC] in [GPE] had not taken place any such conference. None of the mentioned personalities had passed through there. About the two organizations which created the study, the journalists came to the conclusion that they are very strange.

723420ecad19ad5a,1,0,0,0,0,0,First problem ParacusForward like most wiki editors you don't understand the subject but wiki functions like a micropedia if they want more information the real people's encyclopaediais called [ORG]. Either you don't understand the problems of getting past the big brother police state of [GPE] where people are terrified to report the truth or you don't care. I thought perhaps this might be a place to release info but I noticed the spike in info came from reports available via google. One national tv company followed by a local newspaper broke the story on the death threats and hate mail. Then the gangsters responded in an Indian national tabloid. Now they are trying to put the djinn back into the bottle. I don't think you are necessarily malicious the police and security forces wouldn't have to pay you to supress the truth. You are clearly racist or if you prefer the more encylopaediac term ethnocentric. One of the sources the only one I saw that was completely incorrect is [ORG]. They are not so hot on [GPE] and can be truthful on non chinese human rights abuses but in [GPE] they have close links with the major human rights [ORG] which has long been run by the local police. I am sure things will happen but since you haven't got any interest in updating it none will report it here. I don't believe it is helpful either. Wiki did not allow the 24 hours grace to support to keep my fiancee alive again not out of malice but because of aspergers syndrome. I am sending her [ORG] if you haven't read it Wiki does a good summary they are also good for things like definition of satyagraha but for up to date [PERSON] is the first port of call or Twitter. So anyway good luck with your project but the manner in which a few ignorant racist wiki editors claim ownership of this venture with nobody else having the courage to challenge them in case they too are red handed by a confederacy of dunces will make it less relevant. It is far from accurate or up to date. Mainly because editors like you do not have sufficient background understanding of hte politics and culture of the articles you edit. Before I began editing wiki hadn't updated info for several years. No doubt now you will accept unchallenged the false government reports which because they carry the weight of Chinese Propaganda agencies and local newspapers wholly intimidated by [FAC] and corrupt police will now stand unchallenged by the editors who look only at code grammar and syntax and have no understanding of hte problems of truth reporting from within a police state of the third world. Idiots like you will also complain how your own press are not independent.

a0f10c99997cf12f,0,0,0,0,0,0,""" CONFLICT OF INTEREST & NEUTRAL POLICIES OF WIKIPEDIA Dear Wikinews, [GPE] since “conflict of interest” “neutral” is an important subject since “conflict of interest” is being herald by wikinews / wikipedia staff and volunteers, including being used by wikipedia/wikinews administrators and editors with which to have an article /story be deleted, and is grounds for action against a contributor, then please immediately provide documentation that editors, administrators and people providing articles and information to wikipedia and wikinews have no conflict of interest to the articles and stories they create, edit, supervise and/or contribute. For example, did any editor have sexual relationship with a porn star or purchase movies or magazines of a porn star whose bio is listed on wikipedia? This is a conflict of interest. Another example, does any administrator, editor or volunteer of [GPE] and [GPE] including “BlackPearl14"""", “SVTCobra”, “[PERSON]” and “Whoville” own [ORG] stock, have gone to any [ORG] theme park, watch [ORG] movies and/or buy [ORG] products? Then “BlackPearl14"""", “SVTCobra” and “Whoville” and all of these editors and administrators are in conflict of interest. Does the people involved with the wikinews articles about fossilized fish found in [GPE], or with scientific discoveries or with lawsuits, have any connection to these products, places or businesses? Then this is a conflict of interest. What kind of verification did [GPE] and [GPE] use to determine that volunteers including “BlackPearl14"""", “SVTCobra” and “Whoville” don’t sell [ORG] products and have no business with [ORG] and their affiliates? As documented volunteers including “BlackPearl14"""", “SVTCobra” and “Whoville” together claim “conflict of interest” and delete any contribution in regards to Pirates of the [LOC] for either wikinews or wikipedia, and control it by upholding double standards. Thus first we must verify wikinews / wikipedia enforcement of their policy of “conflict of interest” and “neutral”. [ORG] and [ORG] editors don't follow [ORG]' own written polices... “Do you know of an issue that has been forgotten?”. Then you generate and justify reason after reason to state that the above article is not newsworthy, and that [ORG] does not write old news. You even say one thing, and then later change that to be different claims to justify deletion. You keep throwing different claims at an article you have targeted because someone had shown the charges to be untrue. [GPE] and [GPE] continues to uphold double standards, and then make statements with which to justify it. Incredible, you ignore any details provided to your counter your claims, and then accuse the person of not acknowledging your control and your new set of claims. Are you aware that [ORG] editors and wikipedia are in conflict of interest as well? They proven that they have a network of supporting friends, using double standards, without following [GPE] and [ORG]'s own written polices, and such. [ORG] and wikipedia allows editors “fans” to be bias, controlling whatever they choose to write even placing things like porn stars penis size, (copies of that have been documented as well) and to write articles that are one sided, promotional and links to various sites that further promote their cause, yet the editors delete anything that is added that they don’t approve from other people, and then justify reason after reason, such as claiming other people as being a conflict of interest, not being neutral and such if they write or contribute. It's against wikinews and wikipedia policies to simple delete """"when in doubt don't delete"""" and not to show respect when communicating. Yet you simply deleted the entire talk and all related pages and justify various statements calling it whatever you want to get your friends to sign off on your control. If you don’t abide by wikinews and [ORG]’s own written policies, then remove all of the polices and stop telling the public to follow standards which are double standards and more.. Does the owner of the company know you are doing stuff like this? [ORG]: “Blackpearl14"""" Do you, your friends and family or any contributors, editors, administrators or Mr. [PERSON] or their friends and family own stock within [ORG]?

If not, I suggest you have a look at the arbitration case that is currently pending. To facilitate, this was the version most people (except [PERSON]) could live with: Natural selection is the process in which individual organisms that possess favourable traits are more likely to survive and reproduce. Natural selection works on the phenotype, the outward form determined by genes (the genotype), the environment and the interaction between them. Only heritable variations in a trait will be passed on to the next generation and the frequency of favourable heritable traits will increase in subsequent generations. The underlying genetic variation in traits is the result of genetic processes, such as mutations and recombinations, and can undo the effect of natural selection if strong enough relative to the effect of natural selection. Natural selection, together with other mechanisms such as genetic drift and mutations, is an important component of evolution, a cornerstone of modern biological and medical research. The term was introduced by [PERSON] in 1859 in his book """"The Origin of Species"""", as an analogy with a farmer choosing individuals that possess desired characteristics for his breeding stock, which [PERSON] called artificial selection.

He is asserting that the page shows overwhelming bias in some way - according to him there are only two specific single line instances that he cites of bias on the page, both in the bio. This does not a biased page make. I have clearly refuted both of these claims at length, with no response (despite repeated requests) from [PERSON]. 1) The """"garbage"""" passage is balanced with an explanation from a Da spokesperson. The source is quoted, phrase is neutral, and source (scholar [PERSON]) is not in dispute by [PERSON]. The mention is crucial because it explains the """"controversial"""" aspect in first line of lead, and period is alluded to in [GPE] apologies for """"controversial"""" earlier behavior and in the numbers of lawsuits, news articles, and analysis by authorities linked to and discussed in Da page. Also, further explained by Da himself in """"Crazy Wisdom"""" section in teaching. 2) Mention of 1986 breakdown/Divine Emergence. This is a significant event, as attested by [PERSON] press. Source is not biased, all mentions of events are phrased neutrally within basic journalistic standards. Balanced with [PERSON] self-assessment as personally significant event (about which an entire book was written.) 3)""""Undue weight"""" was shown to be unreasonable, as each line is short without subjective exposition. On balance throughout page, all potentially """"controversial"""" material (in every case sourced, cited, and neutrally phrased) is far outweighed by neutral info and Da """"self-assessment."""" Every potentially controversial mention is carefully contextualized and phrased to reflect source, and balanced with an alternate explanation. In every case. Source disputes: 1) Gurdjieff Journal: no specific instances of bias are alleged by [PERSON] from this source. [PERSON] is simply questioning the source without saying why it is an issue. Did not address my point that source is only used because it summarizes [PERSON] from [GPE], Rudi, and [PERSON] accounts. No bias is reflected in [GPE] entry, no has any been revealed. And [PERSON] has failed to show how magazine is biased or """"self-published"""" simply making assertion that it is a """"competing religious organization"""" which is simply unproven (there is no [PERSON] church or """"organization""""). 2) [FAC]: source has been used for other articles, [PERSON] only questions it for single mention that he subjectively finds to his dislike (the Divine Emergence passage). He has not worked to find alternative source that would allow the material about a significant event to remain. Source has been found acceptable to all other editors in past months, as demonstrated by its repeated use. [PERSON] cannot singly enter now and discount source, when not showing WP guideline that effectively discounts it (only his own subjective analysis of the quality of the """"contact"""" page on their website.) All other editors, including myself, have been involved in give an take on this page, making allowances and corrections for each other - even yesterday I made changes to accommodate other editors, including [PERSON]. I do not feel that [PERSON] is meeting this standard, and in particular completely failed to address my repeated specific requests. Because of this, I am removing the [ORG] tag as vandalism and an attempt to discount page. I have requested third party review, and perhaps further dispute resolution. """

Also the Northern Cities accent shift is food for a nice academic paper (that's what scholars do, right?) but incorrectly implies that northern cities like [GPE] or [GPE] did something or other to change the accent from the rural acreas, when the truth is that the rural accent around [GPE] is the same as that in the city.

I put it up last night and it much of it was taken down early this morning. It was information where I provided sources for the comments. I understand that what I wrote can and should be edited. But taking out information that provides sources and citations seems to be an attempt to stifle the information. Dear [PERSON], it IS fair to ask if [PERSON] really is an Indian. He is taking away from actual Indian people the ability to speak for themselves. He has build his whole career on being someone who has experienced the oppression of a minority culture. It is similar to a white middle class Protestant person from [GPE] was writing books about himself being a Jew in [PERSON]'s [GPE]. And don't even say that I just made a inaccurate analogy because [PERSON] himself compares and uses [PERSON] and Nazi analogies. I'm sure that is how you learned about him in the first place because he made this most recent comment about 9/11 victims are all """"[PERSON]'s."""" Look, providing information about whether you are an Indian or not should not be that difficult. Why? You have Indian parents. It is simple as that. Even if you don't have brothers and sisters then you have Indian parents and your parents have brothers and sisters. Correct? Why doesn't anyone in [GPE] know any of these people? This is NOT a cheap shot as you indicated above. It goes to the heart of who he claims that he is. As [PERSON] pointed out: [PERSON] is taking jobs and speaking engagements from real actual Indians and building a whole career on it. Those jobs and speaking engagements should go to actual Indian. Also, [PERSON] made the point that [ORG]'s comments are having a backlash and where is that backlash going? On to Indian Country. Look, no one believes that he should not have the right to say what he wants. We all believe in the First Amendment even if it is difficult speech. However, just don't run around and claim that you are an Indian when you aren't and that you personally have been oppressed. Let's say that I am a white person that lives in [GPE] and I attend a Baptist church and my parents came [GPE] from [GPE], do you really believe that I could run around and write books on Irish experience of oppression in [GPE]? No. But that is what he is doing. And you are calling it a cheap shot. It is not a cheap shot. It goes to who and what he is. He is what we call in Indian Country a Wannabee. There is a whole tribe of Indians called the Wannabee Indians and he is the Chief. The people that making the complaints about his fake Indian heritage are not conservatives by any stretch of the imagination either: [PERSON] (worked for [PERSON]), [PERSON] (Founder of [ORG]), etc. He can say wherever he wants about 9/11 or America, but he shouldn't lie and claim that he is an Indian when he isn't. And schools like the Univ of [GPE] should do a better job of doing there homework when they hire a someone and put out to the world that he is an Indian because he isn't.Keetoowah 17:45, 20 Feb 2005 ([ORG])"""

The golden ratio naturally appears in the 5th roots of unity; if you plot the roots in the complex plane, they form the vertices of a [FAC]. This then explains why you can express a lot of trigonometric angles pi*n/5 in terms of the golden ratio. For example, cos 18 = (b/4)sqrt[2] = 5^(1/4)/2 sqrt[φ]. When you solve a quintic equation, naturally the fifth roots of unity are involved, hence why the radical solution of the quintic x^5-5x+12 = 0 can be expressed in terms of the golden ratio.

This is mearly a fandom among female fans. The two characters are obvious not gay in [GPE]'s story and this dose not need a whole section or even a paragraph. I dislike [PERSON] myself so I distrusted my initial instinct to just do away with it, but prompted by your comment I think I'll just go ahead and act on it. - Personally, I'm a great fan of [PERSON], especially of NaruSasu. However, I don't think it has a place on this page. Yaoi pairings exist of practically every male manga character, it's nothing special. The only thing which might make [ORG] and [PERSON]'s relation more special then other Yaoi pairings, is that, for a shounen manga, their relationship is very deep and emotional. Not to mention the enourmous amount of [ORG]-ai scenes ^^ Still, even this isn't that special or unique. And it wouldn't justify a seperate section. A small footnote, perhaps...not it's own heading [ORG] has acknowledged [PERSON] as being like a brother to him, so that might change the [PERSON] perspective, at least from [ORG]'s standpoint? i hate yaoi, but we gotta admit that [ORG]'s seeming obliviousness toward any female's attraction to him makes him and sasuke prime yaoi-bait [PERSON]'s name?

Why should [PERSON] give a crap about his clan I mean [PERSON] had it worst then him he didn't have any parents,doesn't have any friends,crappy at jutsu,and suffered from something he didn't cause.Sasuke on the other hand had natural talent, the girls loved him,and if he's going to restore his clan than then whats the fuzz Question I just have a question. When [PERSON] and [ORG] fought for the last time, it seemed as though their powers were equally matched. However, does that imply that if [PERSON] used a higher level of [ORG], he would have become more powerful than [ORG] even while he was using [ORG] chakra? Probably not. I'm pretty sure it's stated in the data books that [ORG] (which [PERSON] and [PERSON] both have) is the strongest type of seal, and so far no evidence of anything above [PERSON] Cursed Seals exist.

Yes it is true that the [PERSON] will not/didn't decide who is or should be a Rebbe to whom. They never took that power to themselves nor can I imagine that such power can even be granted. But of course they were granted the power to decide who is the """"Bobover Rebbe"""", who can use the name [PERSON]. Berkshires this is an obvious distinction, one that I previously thought you were faking ignorance of. I now realise that you may have very well been serious. I will therefore try to explain it in more detail. Think for a moment, if [PERSON] should decide tommorow that he no longer wants the title Bobover Rebbe, he no longer wants he Kehilla to be named [PERSON], but rather some name of some other polish town. Does that render him no longer Rebbe to his [ORG]? The connection between a [LOC] and a [ORG] has absolutley nothing to do with his title. There was a dispute in [GPE] over assets, over the title, and over usage of the name [PERSON] and other names used by [PERSON]. A very simple dry Din Torah. The [PERSON] din gave to [PERSON] side all of [ORG] assets, the rights to the title, the name [PERSON], and all other names used by [PERSON]. That does not mean that [PERSON] isn't a Rebbe? It doesn't even mean that he isn't a """"mamshich"""" of his father-in-law or grandfather-in-law. The same way the first [FAC] did not have the title [PERSON] but he was still a """"mamshich"""" of [PERSON]. Try to remove your emotions and be impartial and you may even understand the [PERSON] logic. I am not saying you need to agree, but perhpas if you stand back for a moment you can understand their decision. Putting aside all claims and counter claims as to who should have been selcted as [LOC], I know you must believe that the son-in-law should have been selected, however there is almost unanimous consent between all [GPE] that the will of the majority is respected. The Beth Din made a clear finding within the Psak that Side 2 had a majority. If you follow that logic the [PERSON] is self explanatory. You have a Kehilla. They made a decision as to their Rav and Rebbe. A minority is unhappy. They leave. Can they get a part of the assets? Can they use the name and title? The [PERSON] answered that question with its ruling. I went long here only because I feel a sort of denialist anger simmering within your writting, and I don't think it is warranted. I thought perhaps you can follow the logic. In any event the [PERSON] din did make a decsion who has and can use the title Bobover Rebbe. [PERSON] can no longer refer to himself as [PERSON]. It would be appropriate for you to give this a rest. """

[PERSON]! —Preceding unsigned comment added by 145.120.15.192 Discussion of New Jacque Fresco Article The new article is up. There may be some contentious information in it. I realize the """"Reception"""" section may be most controversial. Some may recognize that there are events and issues missing from the article. This is because some popular claims have not been verified yet or cross-confirmed. On the other hand, there may be some things that are superfluous. Discuss suggestions here. Good luck editing it; it's an intricate string of text. Good job! I do have some concerns with some of the sources, though. """"The Soveriegn Independent"""" is hardly a reliable source, but just one these infinite slanted political outlets claiming to be """"alternative news"""". [GPE] Today is notoriously unreliable as well with load of nonsense news about aliens making it look more like [ORG] that a source of information. In addition [ORG] article is basically an interview with [PERSON], and therefore the source is [PERSON] himself, and as such it may break WP:BLPSPS. That goes for [PERSON] news article as well, but at least it's used much less as a source. And that article works fine as a source for him being called a dreamer, though. ) And why did you add Frescos claim of making a car with only 32 moving parts, not not his claim of inventing a 3D TV with picture so real you could feel you could touch it? ;-) I considered whether some of the news articles will be reliable beings they use [PERSON]'s word as their source. But in many instances, the citation is doubled up and the claim/information is cross referenced between those two sources. But if some is unacceptable then we will have to make adjustments. Maybe it can be rescued if we point out that it's his claims and we say that he *claimed* to develop a car with only 32 moving parts. We have no source for this except two interviews with him, one which he also seems to claim to have invented 3D TV, that articles' reliability is maybe not as high as we want it to be. But I suspect that in biographies we shouldn't have personal claims even if we mar them as such, but somebody with more [ORG] experience than me should make that call. There are some parts of the article regarding the theory of [ORG] that I disagree with, but on the whole it seems to be an outstanding piece of work. There is a lot of stuff about [PERSON] that I would have never known about if this article had never been written. Very nice, short, interesting biography; well done. I like it. ( ) For the most part, I copied that info from the [LOC] Project article. I plan on expanding the [ORG] article to cover more of the theory, and will then modify the info for it on the [PERSON] page.

Very Fine coins will have all the details clear, and there will be wear only on the high points of the design, and most of the fine details shows clearly.

My question is on quality of sources [ORG], sandbox is for draft of texts [ORG], can you just make some helpful comments on the quality of the sources instead of keep on deleting them and evading my valid questions? Thanks. ...the [PERSON] administration decided to try to ensure that international financial relations should be taken out of the control of state [ORG] and should be increasingly centred upon private financial operators. It sought to achieve this goal through exploiting [GPE] control over international oil supplies. It is still widely believed that the sharp and steep increase in oil prices in 1973 was carried out by the [LOC] states as part of an anti-Israel and anti-US policy connected to the Yom Kippur war. Yet as we now know, the oil price rises were the result of [GPE] influence on the oil states and they were arranged in part as an exercise in economic statecraft directed against [GPE]’s ‘allies’ in [LOC] and [GPE]. And another dimension of the [PERSON] administration’s policy on oil price rises was to give a new role, through them, to the [GPE] private banks in international financial relations. The [PERSON] administration was planning to get [ORG] to greatly increase its oil prices a full two years before [ORG] did so and as early as 1972 the [PERSON] administration planned for the [GPE] private banks to recycle the petrodollars when [ORG] finally did take [GPE] advice and jack up oil prices. The [PERSON] administration understood the way in which the [GPE] state could use expanding private financial markets as a political multiplier of the impact of [ORG] moves with the dollar. But according to the [PERSON]’s Ambassador in [GPE] at the time, the principal political objective behind [PERSON]’s drive for the [ORG] oil price rise was to deal a crippling blow to the Japanese and European economies, both overwhelmingly dependent on [LOC], rather than to decisively transform international financial affairs. Nevertheless , [PERSON]’s officials showed far more strategic insight into the consequences of what they were attempting than most political scientists would credit any government with. Its capacity for deception both over the oil price rise and in the way in which it manipulated discussions with its ‘allies’ in the [ORG] over so-called ‘international monetary reform’ was brilliant. The [GPE] government realised that the oil price rises would produce an enormous increase in the dollar earnings of oil states that could not absorb such funds into their own productive sectors. At the same time, the oil price rises would plunge very many states into serious trade deficits as the costs of their oil imports soared. So the so-called petrodollars would have to be recycled from the [LOC] through the Western banking systems to non-oil-producing states. Other governments had wanted the petrodollars to be recycled through the IMF. But the [GPE] rejected this, insisting the [LOC] world’s private banks (at that time led by American banks) should be the recycling vehicles. And because the [GPE] was politically dominant in the [LOC], it could get its way... - The Globalization Gamble: The Dollar-Wall Street Regime and its Consequences By [PERSON] http://www.iwgvt.org/files/9-gowan.rtf http://www.marxsite.com/Global%20Gamble2.htm http://www.amazon.com/Global-Gamble-Washingtons-Faustian-Dominance/dp/[PHONE] 218.186.68.129 'I am 100 per cent sure that the Americans were behind the increase in the price of oil. - Sheikh [PERSON], Former Saudi Oil Minister http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2001/jan/14/globalrecession.oilandpetrol http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahmed_Zaki_Yamani [PERSON]: “Why Oil Prices Go Up?

The only 'cultural bias' [GPE] has is that it is 'biased' towards objectively important subjects such as science, which coincidentally happen to be those pursued until recently by the Western society, which incidentally has always been the only culture around at all. The 'undue coverage of women' comes from the fact that there are less notable women. Insisting on 'equal coverage' of women and men will result in unequal proportion of notable and non-notable people. The policies supposed to make the place more accessible to women, such as ill-conceived politeness, will only result in making it less accessible to people who only care about getting the fucking job done. ~~~~"

For example, a prior discussion: The whole story of [PERSON] and the [GPE] is a fraud. There is no such thing as the """"Kumite"""" tournament. Does anyone honestly believe that such a world class underground full contact tournament could have gone on, and there would remain no evidence of it beside Dux's testimony? Anyone who could produce evidence of such a thing would have a million dollar story, but no one has. Wouldn't someone eventually come forward, or one or two fighters maybe speak out against it? What about the families of the fighters? Wouldn't they notice that their loved ones come home with broken bones and missing teeth? Dux himself claims that there were fatalities. In that case wouldn't the families of the dead fighters investigate what happened? Dux further claims that there were spectators gambling in the event (as in the movie), then how could they keep the silence of the spectators for all these years? To this day there remains no video, or pictures or anything to substantiate Dux's claims. Dux further claims that he holds the record for the fastest """"kick with a knockout"""" at 72 mph. This makes no sense whatsoever. Is there a cop with a radar gun next to ring, measuring the speed of every strike? A 72 mph kick seems impossible, as swords don't even swing that fast. Someone wouldn't just """"jump into"""" such an event either, but they would have training partners, and a record of their fighting career.

He is a martial artist, but nothing like he claims. The only thing that's been knocked out here is [PERSON]'s credibility. Soldier of [ORG] magazine exposed his lies about his military career. Using the Freedom of information act they showed that the actual years of his service in the military don't match up with his claims.

They exposed a picture of him in the military as a hoax, by showing that the ribbons and medals on his uniform are inconsistent with his branch of service. His own response to this is that the uniform was a costume that he was wearing on the way to a halloween party. You gotta be kidding me. Dux sued them for libel and lost. He also sued [PERSON], saying that he (Dux) had come up with the story for the movie """"The Quest"""", and that [PERSON] had made a contract with him for royalties that were never paid. Dux failed to produce any evidence of such a contract, and claimed that the missing evidence was destroyed in an earthquake.

The assessment system has been a great success, we have tagged over 4000 articles! Please tag any LGBT related articles you come across by adding {{LGBTProject | class=}} to the talkpage. Please see [ORG] for how to assess an article according to the grading system. [ORG] department has changed its focus, to [ORG] articles about non-English topics and people on which there may be more information on the relevant foreign [GPE]. Please add your name if you are fluent in any language other than English. [GPE] is picking up slowly, with nine people having entered. With over 2000 stubs we need to improve our article quality. Please sign up and get it going! Challenge another user to see how far you can jump a stub! There is an ongoing discussion about the current [ORG] categorisation system here, here, and a little bit here. A special page has now been set up here to deal with this. A Watchlist has been set up to monitor controversial and/or highly vandalised articles. It can also be used for article disputes, just add a note explaining the nature of the dispute. With the influx of so many active members, there is now enough support for a [ORG] studies peer review, which may be found here. It's in the beta phase at the moment, so bear with us if we make any mistakes. Feel free to peer review any articles you have been working on. It was agreed this month to start reducing the uses of the [ORG] board, as many members felt that it was not effective. An open tasks template has been created, bringing together important announcements, [ORG]/FARs, [ORG] reviews, [ORG], the [ORG], and requested articles. You may desire to [ watchlist] it. A Deletion sorting subpage is also now working to bring together [ORG] - this should be bot-driven, but we have not currently tagged enough articles to make this fully automated, so please update the list with any LGBT-related [ORG] you come across.

Especially """"meta step"""" The fact is that LISP compiles it's self practically the same identical way as [ORG] does. Self-hosting compilers are common. Most general purpose language compilers are self-hosted. I pointed out that many of the compilers I wrote or worked on, compiled themselves. And actually the initial development steps of self hosting compilers are the same as described. I was head of [ORG] at [GPE] electronics. Many console games were written using our compilers. All of the compilers were written in an extended [ORG]. Which bootstrapped from scratch. Most were cross compilers for processors our In [ORG] supported. Actually I started with [ORG] that was bought be [ORG] and then sold to [GPE]. A self-hosting metacompiler is a lot easier to bootstrap up then a general purpose language. Historically metacompilers were compiler compilers. Compiler compiler was the general term used in the 60's Then yacc yuked that up being a parser generator. And calling it's self Yet Another Compiler Compiler. Compared to the compiler compilers of 60's yacc is only hacc. Half a compiler compiler. My term was Half Ass Compiler Compiler. There are implementation of yacc that use yacc to compile it's self. So metacompiler (old version) hasn't really separates it's self from other compiler compilers. Sense the start of this despute I have added referanced defination of metacompilers. The [[ORG], 6th edition, published by [ORG] http://www.answers.com/topic/metacompiler] clearly states """" A metacompilers is a compiler that is used chiefly to construct compilers for other programming languages."""" We have gotten into a flame war on the metacompiler talk page over the defining feature: """"The feature that sets a metacompiler apart from a standard compiler-compiler is that a metacompiler is written in its own language and translates itself."""" Defining itself and translating itself this way constitutes the meta-step that sets a metacompiler apart from other compiler-compilers It's true that a metacompiler usually defines it's self. But not all metacompiler were self-hosted for various reasons. Damon really went ballistic when I found a metacompiler written in PL/1 in a reference he gave to prove his position. Going on about me misconstruing his I do not know what. The subjects of compiler-compiler, syntax-directed-compiler, and metacompiler are all closely related. And at one time were the same thing. The distinguishing factors are needed if they are really separate subjects. There have been many metacompiler over the years that are called metacompilers. Some like [GPE], [GPE], and [ORG] are meta compilers An early metacompiler that did not call it's self a meta compiler was: """"A compiler-building system developed by [ORG]"""" Brooker and Morris, Communications of the ACM Volume 7 Issue 7, July 1964 It has a parsing language """"[ORG]"""" and a machine description language """"MDL"""" There is an intermediate """"GSL"""" generation Strategy L:anguage. CWIC was based partly on [PERSON]'s [ORG] compilers and partly on [ORG] developed at SDC The syntax language includes features from [ORG] META. Is unclear of [PERSON] worked on TREE META. Thhe [ORG] paper does not list [PERSON]. I implemented an extended [ORG] compiler compiler on a [ORG]-System-10 between 1969 and 72. I added a machine description language and created a pseudo operation language (macro like functions using most of the [ORG] generator production language). I am very familiar with how CWIC worked. I have taken to using TREE META terminology using unparse rules instead of pattern matching as used in [ORG] documentation. The rules are actually recursive EVAL(ADD[EVAL(X),EVAL(Y)])=> has [ORG] calling it's self on the tree legs and returning local variables in X and Y. That is a feature of tree meta also except tree meta doesn't have local variables. I started an RFC and probably did it wrong as there has been no comments other then our bickering. [PERSON] submitted papers in the [ORG] group in the 80s. [PERSON] said forth is not a meta compiler on his web site (now gone so can't be referanced). This field o"

39c57a4bfa29fa95,0,0,0,0,0,0,"I think the discussion is perhaps obscuring the meaning of the concept of [GPE], which seems more like the impulse towards an object, rather than desire itself. Without desire, we would not eat or drink, and thus cease to be... without desire, as the Dalai Lama has said, there would be no idea of a path, or anyone trying to follow one (more abstract notions of there being no path aside). Taṇhā is therefore it's own thing, without specific translation in this context, but which we all struggle with every moment. That impulse to obtain or avoid which occurs, and which is attempted to be fulfilled blindly by those remaining in delusion. So although [GPE] is linked with desire, it is not desire, nor the object of any desire.. it is that momentary impulse that drives us towards a desire. If we then form our intention around that desire, we make ourselves vulnerable to frustration and anxiety. If, on the other hand, we form intention based upon none of these things, and [ORG] is acknowledged but not acted upon, then we are less vulnerable."

Since we do not currently have a method in place to verify the identity of account holders at account creation, we must verify such donations through external processes. The article has been blanked to allow time for that verification to proceed. The simplest way to verify is to place a release on that external website putting the material into public domain or releasing it under a license compatible with [ORG], which permits modification and reuse, even commercially, as long as authorship credit is given. This release is irrevocable and must continue to be displayed, or the material will need to be removed. A statement such as the following, including the link to the [ORG], would be sufficient: """"The contents of this website (or page, if you are specifically releasing one section) are available for modification and reuse under the terms of [ORG], Version 1.3 and later."""" If you decide to take this route, please put a link to that release on Talk:Felling Cricket Club so we can restore the contents. Alternatively, you may choose to send an e-mail to [ORG] from an address associated with the original publication to [EMAIL] or a postal message to [ORG] permitting re-use under the [ORG]. There is a boilerplate release form at [ORG]:Declaration of consent for all enquiries which can be helpful. Please provide a clear link to the website in your e-mail and specify by name the article on [ORG] in which the material is being used. Once your e-mail is received and processed by a member of [ORG], the article's contents will be restored if your release is legally sufficient.

He will not provide proof of his comic roofis (as in did he actuall draw it himself or did he contract out the work while writing the storie. Both of his books (pamplets) are home published and could be considered very racist! This is not someone that has any creditibily as he has lied several times on his wikipedia page. No RESULTS! On June 12th, 2008 [ORG] says: This is not an example and cannot be proven that YOU actually drew THE strip. Like I said I have been informed this comic in nothing more than 2 or 3 sheets of zerox paper stapled together. Not in the usual format as a printed affair. He uses the term loosely since it’s not a real printed comic. He has no examples of his drawing, what kind of cartoonist doesn’t put their work online. PROVE THAT SHIT! He stated in this post to [GPE] that his book Battle Neverending’s 3 thousand copies sold out in one year which is a total lie. He printed them in 1998 and was still selling them as recent as 2006 http://www.popocculture.com/28/battle-neverending-by-saab-l “[PERSON] is the man who paid out of his own pocket for the second printing (one thousand copies) and third printing (two thousand copies) of [FAC]. I sold all three thousand copies of [FAC] within the span of a year”. (Example #1 of his lies) 2000 copies of [GPE] supposedly sold in one year or as [ORG] states ([PERSON]) which is also unverifiable whether it actually sold that fast since he out an out lied about Battle Neverendings. The first A.D. was published by a small defunct anarchist publisher which describes itself as publishing """"pamphlets"""", sold out and was not reprinted. “However, his claim to fame is the novel he wrote while still in the dorms at [FAC], [GPE], which was so radical a book it got him kicked out of college in 1997.” When in reality “[GPE] wrote """"A.D."""" while a student at [FAC] and spent so much time hawking the book when it was published three years ago that his grades began to fall and the university cut off his financial aid”. (Example #2 of his lies) I ‘m not admitting any mistake about [ORG] (you always want to appear very radical so I’m sure you told him you were homeless on the streets of [GPE]) because you made that up as well as being homeless! The only place you’ve been homeless was on your mothers couch for THREE YEARS ALL THE WHILE REFUSING TO WORK A DAY JOB, IM SURE TO YOUR MOTHERS AMAZEMENT ON JUST HOW MUCH OF A BUM HER SON TURNED OUT TO BE! (Example #3 of his lies) “In all the WEEKS you've been STALKING me, NOT ONE motherfucker has so much as e-mailed me and asked, """"is this anonymous, psuedonym-using piece of shit correct about anything?""""”. I know nobody reads your shit anyway so I wouldn’t expect any response. I write these things simply because I know that you can’t handle risking your supposed fame! (Which is all you are interested in anyway). Your not an activist you’re an opportunist masking yourself in anarchy. And finally I have this victory over your Racist Spoiled Black Privileged ass! Here’s the dialog about shutting [PERSON] page because firstly it’s chalked full of made up shit and secondly they finally realize that he’s just another home publishing hack! I've looked into the books listed in the bibliography... The first was published by a small defunct anarchist publisher which describes itself as publishing """"pamphlets"""", sold out and was not reprinted. The second was described by [ORG] as """"obviously a low-budget and quite-possibly home-printed affair"""". There is no evidence that either of these books received a credible review, much less meet WP:BOOK.

Actually ,you need better ideas to deal with life. I am not foolish like you to spend any amount of my time bothering about rubbish written by stupid people like you who have no work in real life and spend days editing pages on [PERSON] that no one bothers to read. Some people are just unfortunate like you and 2over0. And if you are troubled by my calling that actress """"sleazy"""", then that's your problem. Cos that's the only work she has done and the press uses precisely that term while referencing her work. You also spoke about writing """"accurate"""" information on wikipedia. Ironic, when you don't even bother finding out what is accurate, and spend endless hours blocking, and acting admin as if it is an important position in yourCarry on with your scribble game. And if you feel threatened by media exposure, then that shows you knew you were wrong. It's only when people are wrong that they feel threatened. Pity your personality. Also, you ended by writing that """" it's clear you aren't a journalist, and have no means of carrying out your threat """" - LOL. Sad, that you lived in that illusion. For JOKERS like you who are totally idle,and who scribble away in virtual life. Oh wait, that may be the only position you probably have or will have ever in your unfortunate life. Carry on with your scribble game. And if you feel threatened by media exposure, then that shows you knew you were wrong. It's only when people are wrong that they feel threatened. Pity your personality. Also, you ended by writing that """" it's clear you aren't a journalist, and have no means of carrying out your threat """" - LOL. Sad, that you lived in that illusion. For JOKERS like you who are totally idle,and who scribble away in virtual pages on Wiki-scribble-pedia, will obviously withdraw from the truth. You yourself have no idea at all if I am a journalist, and you write that it's clear that I am not. Well, you are also inane and a clown to fool yourself. I had all means, and the said article has already been published. I had NO TIME to let you know, since I am a busy person, unlike you and do not find time to come scribble on virtual pages that clowns like you , 2OVERO, 2/0, [ORG], [ORG], FISHERQUEEN (yeah, we named you again - Suck it up), [ORG] etc. do all your life. You will find that information, depending on which [ORG] part of the world you live in. And like last time, you can go ahead and block me this time too. For , no one cares two hoots for your silly blocking games. We do have a life, unlike losers like you. Maybe its time for you to go fish in real life, so that you can come anywhere remotely close to having a life - LOL. SO, [GPE], GROW UP and [ORG], You IDLE CLOWN OR ELSE, YOU WILL REMAIN A LOSER ALL YOUR LIFE. WHO CARES ANYWAY WHAT INANE, PUERILE LOSERS LIKE YOU DO IN THEIR LIVES.

Now he is Prince george of [GPE] he don't need a courtesy title. If [PERSON] predesease his father, the new born will prince [PERSON] of [GPE] and etc. eg:- [PERSON] third son was styled [ORG], The Duke of Gloucester, [PERSON] of [PERSON] and [PERSON]. his [GPE] Prince William then Prince [PERSON] after his brothers death) hold Princely titles because of [ORG] male line grand children, as called Prince William of [PERSON] and Prince Richard of Gloucester instead of [PERSON] of Ulster. But [PERSON], prince Richards children don't have princely titls because they are kings great grand children(Only Prince of Wales elderst sons children get princely titles among kings grand children) and his son called [PERSON] of Ulster and sons heir and elderst son called Lord Culloden. When the child has been born, assuming we don't know the given name immediately, should we move this article to Prince of [GPE] or Princess of [GPE]? This article may be linked on the [ORG] page under In the news, so we should probably be prepared for that. I noticed there was already an Unnamed Prince of [GPE] and an Unnamed Princess of [GPE] redirecting to [ORG] (I have just edited them to redirect here instead). Online No, that would not be right. The child will not be Prince of [GPE] or Princess of [GPE], i.e. that will not be a substantive title like Prince of [GPE] or [ORG]. The child will be a prince of the [GPE] known as Prince(ss) X of [GPE]. It would be best to just leave the article at Child of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge until the child is named; the present title certainly won't become less accurate or less precise once the childis born. The child will be officially entitled Prince (Name) of [GPE] or Princess (Name) of [GPE]. So probably not. (Want to have a chat?) Prince(ss) NN of [GPE] would be the best answer, but seeing as the child will be given a name within the first couple days anyway, there's no point moving the article only to move it again a couple days later. The Princess NN of Country came about mostly because of the Danish tradition of waiting until the baptism to name the child, so the articles were made when the children were born and then we had an article in place while we waited for the name. In other cases, ie Princess Estelle of [GPE] or Princess Eleonore of [GPE], the article Princess NN of [GPE]/[GPE] was created and then moved within a day or two to its proper location when their names were announced. But this article is already in place, so moving it, only to move it yet again a day or two later is pointless. Personally, I think [PERSON] is a great name for a Prince, although [ORG] also has a certain ring to it. I agree with [GPE]. Additionally, we might not be certain as to the child's precise style until one is used (styles have broken precedent before, remember!), so we really ought to avoid assuming something based on precedent which could soon turn out to be WRONG... BD The style of the boy is given as """"His Royal Highness Prince [name] of [GPE]"""" on the official webpages of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge - so speculation about that can now end...

Using your reasoning, we should never be able to oppose on comprehensiveness issues either, because if a consensus of the regular editors of the page says that the article is comprehensive, then it must be. [ORG]'s entire purpose is to try to get a larger perspective on whether the article meets the appropriate policies or guidelines (in other words, consensus can change). I do think that the [ORG] page suffers sometimes because most of its editors have a very strong [GPE]. That is understandable; people usually work on topics they are passionate about (either for or against). I fully acknowledge (and praise) that they are trying to make the article as [GPE] as possible, but when you hold a strong [GPE] sometimes it is hard to recognize where neutral actually is. That is why processes like [ORG], [ORG], and PR are essential, because then you can get (hopefully) the opinions of people who don't hold a strong [GPE] on the topic. I would encourage you to post at [ORG] to see what the consensus is for how to review an article - are [GPE] and comprehensiveness concerns off-limits?

a01d197f73ee31e9,0,0,0,0,0,0,""" Statement I was angry at what I consider to be a massive campaign against [PERSON]. I rarely, if ever, agree with [PERSON] on anything, but I felt the opposes were over the top. My comment about riff-raff is not uncivil. Riff-raff is a child's word, if I wanted to be insulting or uncivil I would have used much harsher words than that, I assure you. Further, I felt that many of the attacks on [PERSON] by the opposers were far worse than that, even the before-refactored comment. I was responding to my believe that [PERSON] Poor needs to be allowed to bring his dissent to [ORG] articles, despite the fact I totally disagree with his viewpoint. Keeping controversial articles free of being walled gardens of woo is a goal that [GPE] should seek. We cannot allow even the most righteous people WP:OWN whole swaths of subject matter. Not to be pointed, but the greater scientific community was patently wrong on eugenics, the popular bastardization of [PERSON]'s natural selection, at the turn of the 20th century. I've been reading an excellent book, War Against the Weak by [PERSON], which catalogs just how it was a group of determined American and British scientists popularized this hideous science and even directly inspired the tactics of [PERSON]. It is a chilling account of what happens when determined scientists insist their viewpoint is the only viewpoint that matters and how uncritical groupthink led to horrendous travesties being perpatrated against our poor and sick at that period of time. My point is that groupthink is bad. Refusing to debate opposing views is bad. [PERSON] brings the necessary questioning which ultimately results in better articles because lazy and poorly sourced material is kept out, while some space is given for the opposing viewpoint. I feel that my fellow colleagues treatment of [PERSON], based mostly on his behavior on another project - which by the way is admittedly slanted (the """"conserv"""" in CP should have been the hint) - was aweful. My comments were not directed at anyone in particular and were only meant as an attempt to console [PERSON] on his good faith attempt to serve the community again.

A few points to remember: There is nothing to split from the cuisine of [GPE] article. Splitting occurs when we have too much content and some must be moved elsewhere. That is not the situation here. There is nothing to remove from the parent topic. What was recommended is for an editor to take up the task of expanding the subject, spinning out the topic into a new daughter article. This involves an editor who is willing and interested to research and write about the cuisine of Native Hawaiian and to give it an expanded scope and treatment in a larger space. This means expanding what we already have, not moving it to another article and adding more copypaste from other articles. Writing means, doing the research, reading the books and scholarly papers, and doing the hard work. It does not mean taking what we already have and duplicating it over and over again. That's not how this works. You basically duplicated the entire cuisine of [GPE] article here. Since that's a completely different topic, it makes no sense to talk about ethnic and local cuisine here. If you don't know what the cuisine of [LOC] entails, then do the research. It does not mean any food that anyone of Native Hawaiian ethnicity eats. It has a specific, pre-contact definition and scope. When you copied the content, you also copied the sources without adding the actual references. As a result, nobody can easily verify the content. Of course, I can, since I'm the one that went to the library and found the books and cited them in the original article. You will have to add each full source to this article, otherwise it will get moved back to draft/sandbox space again. You can't just keep copying material without doing the hard work. You will need to add each single full reference to this article. Don't expect others to cleanup after you, especially when other editors did the actual research and footwork you refuse to do. Per the [ORG], please do not surround text with multiple images. [PERSON], you've been reminded of this many times now. Keep this in draft space until you've done the necessary work.

These include all the ones spoken today. There were several early splinter groups from the [ORG] culture. Three of these were the cultural ancestors of the Armenians, [PERSON] and Albanians. There may have been more but the languages descended from theirs are so poorly documented we don’t know much of them. A larger splinter group from [ORG] culture was the [ORG] people.

3b96b7edb04185f0,0,0,0,0,0,0,""" Edit request on 24 January 2012 I'm requesting that the [PERSON] article be edited to reflect the fact [PERSON] believed in """"Helter Skelter"""" but this has NOT been confirmed by the man himself. As a matter of fact, [PERSON] stated in a recent interview that """"Helter Skelter"""" was NOT on [PERSON]'s mind and the killers had the instinct in them already to commit the murders. This interview can be found on """"YouTube"""" and is what I consider to be a total contradiction to [ORG]'s past claims. This is how I feel the following article sections should read: {[PERSON] allegedly believed in what he called """"Helter Skelter,"""" a term taken from the song of the same name by The Beatles. It was said [PERSON] believed [PERSON] to be an impending apocalyptic race war, which he described in his own version of the lyrics to the [PERSON]' song but this is debatable since [PERSON] never publicly confirmed anything of the sort. According to prosecutor [PERSON], [PERSON] supposedly believed his murders would help precipitate that war. From the beginning of his notoriety, this connection with rock music linked him with a pop culture in which he ultimately became an emblem of insanity, violence and the macabre.} {[PERSON] Main article: [PERSON] ([PERSON] scenario) For some time, [PERSON] had been saying that racial tension between blacks and whites was growing and that blacks would soon rise up in rebellion in [GPE]'s cities.[29][30] He had emphasized [PERSON], [PERSON]'s assassination, which had taken place on April 4, 1968.[23] On a bitterly cold New Year's Eve at [ORG], the [ORG] members, gathered outside around a large fire, listened as [PERSON] explained that the social turmoil he had been predicting had supposedly also been predicted by the Beatles.[26] The White Album songs, he allegedly declared, told it all, although in code. Furthermore, it was said he maintained (or would soon maintain), the album was directed at the Family itself, an elect group that was being instructed to preserve the worthy from the impending disaster.[29][30] In early January 1969, the [ORG] escaped the desert's cold and positioned itself to monitor [GPE]'s supposed tension by moving to a canary-yellow home in [GPE], not far from the [PERSON] Ranch.[2]:244–247[26][31] Because this locale would allow the group to remain """"submerged beneath the awareness of the outside world,""""[2]:244–247[32] [PERSON] called it the [PERSON], another [PERSON] reference. There, Family members prepared for the impending apocalypse,[33][34] which, around the campfire, [PERSON] had allegedly termed """"Helter Skelter,"""" after the song of that name. By February, the so-called """"Helter Skelter"""" vision was complete. The [ORG] would create an album whose songs, as subtle as those of the [PERSON], would trigger the predicted chaos. This is just a theory however and many have viewed the album differently. Supposedly, ghastly murders of whites by blacks would be met with retaliation, and a split between racist and non-racist whites would yield whites' self-annihilation. Blacks' triumph, as it were, would merely precede their being ruled by the Family, which would ride out the conflict in """"the bottomless [ORG] secret city beneath [PERSON] At the [GPE] house, while [ORG] members worked on vehicles and pored over maps to prepare for their desert escape, they also worked on songs for their world-changing album. When they were told [PERSON] was to come to the house to hear the material, the women prepared a meal and cleaned the place; but Melcher never arrived.[29][33]} {[GPE] shooting On May 18, 1969, [PERSON] visited [PERSON] to hear [PERSON] and the women sing. Melcher arranged a subsequent visit, not long thereafter, on which he brought a friend who possessed a mobile recording unit; but he himself did not record the group.[2]:156,185[36] By June, [PERSON] was allegedly telling the [ORG] they might have to show blacks how to start """"[PERSON] Skelter"""".[2]:244–247[34][37] When [PERSON] supposedly tasked [PERSON] with obtaining money supposedly intended to help the [ORG] prepare for the conflict, [PERSON] defrauded a black drug dealer named [PERSON] """"Lotsapoppa"""" Crowe. Crowe responded with a threat to wipe out everyone at Spahn Ranch. [PERSON] countered on July 1, 1969, by shooting [PERSON] at his [GPE] apartment.[2]:99–113[2]:91–96[38][39] [PERSON]'s mistaken belief that he had killed [PERSON] was seemingly confirmed by a news report of the discovery of the dumped body of a [GPE] in [GPE].

997cbe5ea298b93e,0,0,0,0,0,0,""" Ceiling fan article edit Thanks for your recent contrib to the ceiling fan article. It's good when people edit things, because it sparks thought in new directions. I admire the originality of your thought, and the level of observance required to note such a detail as a fan's usefulness in humid versus dry climates. [GPE] I mean this in an amusing way, rather than offensivelyyou were totally wrong. The statement about a fan's usefulness in dry versus humid climates was, in fact, not backwards. This is how the statement read before you edited it: """"Since a fan creates its cooling effect by speeding the evaporation of moisture on human skin, its perceived usefulness is directly correlated with the amount of humidity (moisture) in the room. In dry environments, such as desert climates, a fan has a lesser perceived usefulness than in humid environments; this is especially notable during cold weather, where a humid environment has a pronounced wind-chill effect which is lacking in dry environments."""" You said, in your edit summary, to refer to the heat index article. So I did. The introductory paragraph to that article reads: """"The human body normally cools itself by perspiration, or sweating, in which the water in the sweat evaporates and carries heat away from the body. However, when the relative humidity is high, the evaporation rate of water is reduced. This means heat is removed from the body at a lower rate, causing it to retain more heat than it would in dry air."""""""" ...thus proving that my original statement in my ceiling fan article was correct. In humid climates, heat is naturally removed from the body at a lower rate than in dry climates, causing a person to remain hotter longer than in dry climates. Thus, there is a greater need for a fan than in desert climatesthus it is perceived as being more useful. I saw, via your userpage, that you've grown up in [GPE]. I'm originally from [LOC] myself, and I lived here my whole life save for two years in [GPE] very distinct desert climate. The lack of humidity out there is actually quite a pleasure. In the summer there, it can be 105 degrees and feel no hotter than 85 here on the east coastyou look at the thermometer there and say """"Wow, I didn't realize it's over 100this isn't that uncomfortable!"""". I wasn't dying for a fan there, the way I do here. Also, the converse is truethe winters out there are more bearable than they are here. They don't seem as cold, because the humidity is really what adds the """"bone-chilling"""" factor into the mix. Anyhow, I've reverted your edit to the ceiling fan article. But thanks for reading it and contributing! In the future, before making edits to statements of fact in an already-established article, please get a consensus on the article's talk page. Thanks! """

Unfortunately, due to the tyrannical trends of namby pamby liberalism (Labour [GPE], for example), not much genuine research can be done in the subject, because it's quite politically incorrect these days. For example, when a university professor says that on average Black people score lower in IQ tests than white people, said professor gets voted out of tenure 600 to 1. So it's not good practice for libertarian capitalists to bother trying to counter argue against all this namby pamby left wing crap. Labour [GPE] is a twisted experiment, which, although capitalist and ostensibly right wing, has introduced very bizarre left wing projects in to the political playing field: such as, teaching young children about homosexuality in schools, trying to make gay hate a crime like race hate, trying to make condemnation of monotheistic religions a crime, with use of the truth distorting term 'incitement to religious hatred' etc. We are on the losing side, those of us who love truth.

f9b2ae33352d221a,0,0,0,0,0,0,""" [PERSON], you cannot be that naive. I suspect that you have realised that you have stepped over the mark. By even suggesting, in a widely read public forum such as this, that the GLdF is an irregular [PERSON] is the vilest and most vicious attack that any [ORG] can make upon the Grand Master, officers and members of any other Masonic jurisdiction, and it is unforgiveable. Your Grand Lodge does NOT state anywhere in the public domain, that the GLdF is an IRREGULAR Grand Lodge and I challenge you to demonstrate to us where yu say it does. Not your word for it, a reliable source i.e. [ORG] of [GPE] itself. Prove me wrong, I won't mind. What is clear is that [ORG] of [GPE] is bound by the policies of [ORG] of Masons of [LOC] which has specifically removed any claim to be the arbiters of Masonic regularity, quite rightly, and good on them. Take a look at their 2007 and 2008 reports. They are on their website and in print in black and white. Incontrovertable historical evidence. And then you come along. And you arbritrarily vilify The Grand Lodge of [GPE] and [ORG]. Bear in mind that I have been, and we are, in contact with the Conference and its [ORG] over these very issues. They have graciously received our submissions and their statements have been carefully worded accordingly, to include [ORG] throughout the world. This is their and your current [ORG] policy: 2007: """"It must again be stated that the [ORG] does not determine the regularity of a [ORG]; it only evaluates the facts available to determine if the entity meets the standards for recognition, as adopted by [ORG] of [LOC], and reports those findings to the member [ORG] of this Conference for their use."""" 2008: """"We must state again that even though a [FAC] may practice regular [PERSON], we only determine whether [ORG] meets all the standards for recognition, as established by this Conference."""" Not our words, or [ORG] of [GPE]'s words, their words. [ORG] of Masons of North America (including the Grand Master of [ORG] of [GPE]) is NOT the arbiter of Masonic regularity - OFFICIAL POLICY. This is an encyclopedia. There is NO place for personal prejudices and political edicts from any partisan [FAC], yours or ours. History rises above that sort of thing. If you want to express political opinions then write a book and publish it under you own name, but don't call it history. History is neutral. We can cooperate on the history of [FAC], but we must first agree to eliminate partisan politics or it is a complete waste of time. By the way, the """"Antients"""" Grand Lodge, properly named [ORG] and Accepted Masons According to [ORG] is the [ORG]. Please read The Charter of Compact 1813; it is quite specific on this matter. [ORG] said. And in your version of French Masonic history you have completely ommitted to mention our [ORG] which was instituted and based in [GPE] c.1718 but certainly no later than 1720. You probably don't know about it, but it is this sort of ommission which may be rectified if you calm your passions and your prejudices and get down to the serious business of reporting [PERSON] history. It is a very big, and I believe important subject which is not served by insisting on UGLE political correctness. The [ORG] is NOT Masonic history, it is a small part of Masonic history, and in this case represents a minority of [ORG] in [GPE]. And finally, I can assure you that [ORG] of [GPE] couldn't give a [ORG] for the opinions of the [ORG]. Do you consider, even for one second, that if they were the least bit concerned about what the [ORG] thought of them that they would have entered into a formal Treaty of Amity with [ORG]?

I firmly believe that most of the trouble [LOC] got herself into probably comes from the even application of these rules, whose impact on core policies was probably not properly gauged prior to their application. What I'm suggesting is for the community to go back to the drawing board, discuss these rules, see how they can best be applied (are there necessary exceptions, for example?) derive a consensus and implement it. This would avoid this unpleasant feeling of being experimented upon that some editors have, and would go a long way towards reinstating the feeling that the community has the final say on its destinies (by shaping the new rules applying to it).

It is probably written and maintained by a member of staff at the school, but even so it should give a neutral point of view. For example, the old fashioned grammar school attitudes that the school desperately hangs on to (these include uniforms that haven't changed at all since the 1950's, authoritarian attitudes that are concerned by uniform more than actually making sure the children get a good education, etc, etc...) cause tension between students and teachers, as these obviously dubious values do not fit well into modern society. Just to add to this, the most recent ofstead report strongly emphasises the need for student and teacher relationships to improve. however, because of the senior staff all living in the 1930's, they took this to mean they need to enforce the rules more, with stronger emphasis on uniform and weaker emphasis on educational support; this has simply degraded student's relationships with their teachers (especially the so - called """"senior staff"""" who don't even teach but instead spend their time punishing people for petty things - the school even employs a certain member of staff whose job it is to be horrible - ironically she is actually called [PERSON]!) even further.

afe05ef9792cf9c7,0,0,0,0,0,0,"Seems like a lot is missing from this article, especially the part about the atom bomb. Here's a few reviews from [ORG]: A fiercely nationalistic book every American should read, August 5, 2002 This book was a million-seller in [GPE], and was translated into English in 1991. The author was a promininet Japanese politician. The book is dated, and history has not always borne out the author's views. Nonetheless, anyone attempting to understand modern [GPE] should read it. Some of the passages will be very surprising and disturbing. Author [PERSON] avoids the conventionally polite Japanese protocol and forcefully states that [GPE] is the equal of [GPE], that [GPE] should have its own defense forces, (and strong ones), that Japanese computer technology is second to none and should be used as a negotiating tool, and [GPE] will be the most influential power in dealing with Asian nations. [LOC] berates [GPE] for racism, and contends that the atomic bomb was not used on [GPE] because Germans were white, and Japanese were yellow. He asserts that nations colonized by [GPE] have been far more successful following liberation than those colonized by [GPE]. The book exemplifies the growing trend toward national pride in [GPE], and also forcefully addresses the feeling by many Japanese that their nation is misunderstood. Plainly, the sentiments in the book foretell a troubled period in Japanese-American relations, and remind us that the Japanese have not forgotten [GPE] any more than [GPE] has [FAC]. [PERSON]'s call for a constructive dialogue between the two nations is well taken. Otherwise, the future looks cloudy at best. Very highly recommended, even if slightly dated. emblematic parochialism and obscure nationalist rage, September 19, 2006 I read this book in the [ORG]-translated version as a [ORG] aide concerned about the rise of [GPE], which included as co-author one of the leaders of [ORG]). While interesting for scholars, as I glanced thru this version - which is watered down but still white hot with anger - I was struck at how far off base the predictions of the man seem today. Afterall, when it was written, [GPE] was at the crest of the bubble economy, it appeared as if Japanese computer chips (and its electronic industries) would confer great power on the country (they could refuse to sell components that went into [GPE] missiles), and the [GPE] was in a now-unimaginable phase of self doubt. As such, the way things have turned out, after nearly 16 years of stagnation and the rise of high tech manufacturer-competitors elsewhere, reveal the author to have been so badly mistaken regarding the trajectory that [GPE] would take as to be laughable. In a deeper sense, it points to the fact that [LOC] did not understand the economic forces at work at the time and so was full of utterly baseless nationalistic bravado. [GPE]'s economic rise was based upon the post-war reconstruction boom, then a relatively protected economy that allowed huge undustrial combines to band together as cartels (gouging their won consumers to sell at low prices abroad to gain marketshare and crush competitiors), and lastly to a number of significant management innovations ([ORG], just-in-time manufacturing, etc.) that are reflected in the fact that they make excellent cars. However, it was basically a follower economy making products that have become commoditized by cheaper manufacturers elsewhere in [LOC] - just as its innovations became widely emulated - and corrupted by the money generated in real estate speculation that eventually collapsed in a deflationary spiral. Meanwhile, its political reforms have been weak at best, and senselessly nationalistic at worst. [LOC] understood none of this and casts no light on any of it of value. Instead, he drags out pre-WWII arguments about the innate superiority of the Japanese character and similar rather ugly arguments. He is also appalingly loose with the facts: for example, he claims that the [GPE] bombed [GPE], but not [GPE] with the atom bomb for racist reasons (Japanese were yellow, Germans were not) - but if you know a minimum of history, which Isihara apparently doesn't, you would realise that at the time of the German defeat (April, 1945) the bomb was not yet completed (it was first test detonated the following July)! The book is full of this kind of sloppiness. What he does succeed at, however, is expressing the resentment that parochial Japanese nationalists felt at the time. In retrospect, his arrogance appears as breathtaking as it is ignorant. But his anger and resentment, and what they reflect of Japanese attitudes, is very real indeed. Seen this way, the book is one long crypto-racist rant. [GPE] has a long way to g"

[PERSON] y [GPE] Hi [PERSON], thanks for all the work on [PERSON] y [GPE] article. Interesting material, and I'd never seen it before. I have one minor question. Was his father really born in [GPE]? I knew [PERSON] was, but I had assumed his father was from [GPE], because of the royal tutoring. The oversight can perhaps be attributed to haste. My sources mention nothing abut his birthplace, but a [ORG] birth is much more likely, given the timeframe and his position. I changed it to peninsular, only to discover the deficiencies in that article. I presume you are referring to S y G's theories about the origin of the [LOC] and the evangelization of [PERSON] when you say you found the new material interesting? Such theories were actually quite common, and it appears that [GPE] was one of the first to come up with them, or maybe just the first to popularize them. The [PERSON] were way behind. 8) One final note: I'm guessing that """"book examiner"""" is your translation of """"corregidor general"""". Is this correct? My English-language sources make use of the term """"censor"""", which I can only guess is one and the same as corregidor general. I have added [ORG]) to the censor dab page, in hopes of composing an article on the post, but refrained from linking it from the [GPE] article. If I am in error, please correct me. Thanks for your comments, and the pic looks great, Yes, if I remember correctly he was listed as corregidor general, but I'm away from my encylopedias now and can't definitely verify that. I'm sure I can find a copy of [ORG] in a library here (I'm in [GPE] now), but it may be a little while before I get to that. """"Book examiner"""" wasn't really my translation. I had no idea what the original term meant, but I found him referred to as """"book examiner"""" on a web page, and I identified the two.

However, now that I understand the process I will definitely start a page discussion in the future.

e219a6812ea5b920,0,0,0,0,0,0,""" My signature and your actions ~ I thought about taking this to a dispute hearing, but I couldn't be fucked. So, I'm just going to outline here why I think that your blocking of my account was unjustified and against policy. You stated when you blocked me, """"anon. only, account creation blocked) with an expiry time of indefinite (personal attack in signature - will unblock on signature change"""" . I disagree with your action on three levels. The first is that it was a personal attack, the second on the indefinite ban, and the third on any action at all. Why it wasn't a personal attack """"The primary purpose of creating any block is to protect [ORG] and its editors and users from harm."""" (From WP:BP). Of the list of reasons, on WP:BP the only one plausibly applicable is """"Disruption"""". Under this it has """"A user may be blocked when his/her conduct severely disrupts the project — his/her conduct is inconsistent with a civil, collegial atmosphere and interferes with the process of editors working together harmoniously to create an encyclopedia."""" And """"Blocks for general incivility are controversial"""". In no way could any of my actions be considered """"severely"""" disruptive. Or even simply disruptive. While it could be argued that my signature was generally uncivil (and I disagree, more later), blocking for this reason is controversial and should have been discussed first. So, from [GPE]:BP there is no reason (in my opinion) to block. Now we examine WP:NPA. This is simply, """"Do not make personal attacks anywhere in [GPE]"""" and I agree with it. The point here is """"personal"""". My signature was not a personal attack on anyone. It was a generalised comment and an """"in joke"""" (I can't help it if you are not in on the joke). For the """"attack"""" to be personal, you would need to find someone who was """"attacked"""", you would not be able to do this. So, my signature did not constitute an attack on anyone, it did not disrupt discussion or affect the quality of my edits, thus it should not be a factor in anything. As to general incivility, I simply disagree. From WP:CIVIL, """"Whereas incivility is roughly defined as personally targeted behavior that causes an atmosphere of greater conflict and stress"""". My signature was not """"personally targeted behavior"""" (as explained above), and I also fail to see how it could cause an atmosphere of """"conflict"""" or """"stress"""". There is nothing in this policy which is applicable in this case. Why I should not have been blocked In blocking me indefinitely, you violated WP:BP which states, """"Established users with significant constructive edits should not be indefinitely blocked except when there is a community ban. In all other cases, they should be handled with appropriate time-limited blocks or arbitration. Indefinite blocks should not usually be placed on [ORG] users (whether individual IPs or [ORG] ranges) in order to avoid inadvertently blocking legitimate users."""" In blocking me at all, I also feel that you violated WP:BP. You did not have a clear reason to block me, and you did so indefinitely. In these cases, you should have posted at WP:ANI asking for advice and/or detailing why you felt that the block was needed. What could have happened So, what could you have done? Well, the simplest thing would have to post on my talk page a comment asking me to change my signature and pointing to the policy which it violated (see the previous case for an example). If you had have done this (and I had agreed with your argument) then I would have simply changed my signature. If I had failed to change my signature, then you could have discussed it with me more, and/or taken it to a hearing. Conclusion As I said at the beginning, I didn't want to take this to a hearing. However, I feel that I would be perfectly within my rights to do so, and I reserve the right to do so. This, by the way, is simply a statement. What would I like you to do? Well, an apology would be nice, perhaps something worded along the lines of """"I'm sorry for not talking to you first, not checking policy and for violating policy by indefinitely blocking you"""". If you are unable to give an apology (for whatever reason, say you believe that you were in the right and still are), then I would appreciate a comment regardless. A comment on my userpage would be noticed faster, but here would be fine as well.

f42828ccf3249763,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[ORG] the problem here is a lag from the old Ukrainian orthography that has since changed. A similar case existed in [GPE], but much more amplified, when the changes of 1930s and subsequent orthographic reforms were very noticeable it affected the way whole cities were spelled. Example [GPE] and [GPE]. In fact that is the reason why there are two versions of Belarusian edition wikipedia, one uses the old and the other the official adopted version. In [GPE] language a similar happened but to lesser extent, and only some cities were affected e.g. Rivne became [ORG], [GPE] became [GPE], [PERSON] became [PERSON] and so on. With our city as far as I am aware it too became Мукачево. During the 1990s some of those changes were reversed, and it really falls to because in [GPE] there are sufficient differences between dialects, in fact if you compare western and central Ukrainian the differences would be more vivid than that of British and American English. So for some cases like [ORG], it was much up to the locals, because Volhynian dialect pronounces the city like its spelled, whilst somewhere in [ORG] they will say it as [ORG]. It seems that with [PERSON] it is a case that the version used by locals is not entirely adopted nationwide. But then again there are some silly people in the government who use spellings such as [PERSON] but that is outright stupid, because even in classic orthography that version would never be used. The -pil originates from the connotation of field like [PERSON]. The -pol comes from the Greek root for city, like Sevastopol. All the more reasons why we should stick to [PERSON] and help to leave the archaic spelling where it belongs in history."

Apparently my decision not to allow comments that are basically spam, lazy insults, illiterate ramblings and screeching from morons who don't listen (but just use the channel as their own forum) means I am anti free speech.

Attempting to belittle, hurl abuse and calling me UAF/Marxist/far left/rapist/paedophile with absolutely no basis (libelous in reality). 2.

THEY are what is wrong with the world and they are what is trying to stop us evolving; their motivation is hatred and ignorance....proven by their labelling of everyone who disagrees with them as communists, [ORG], Marxists and Liberals (and more unbelievably fascists?!?) with no basis.

[PERSON] came out with the most support and was brought up to Good Article standard after a lot of work by [PERSON] before going on as the F1 portal selected article a couple of weeks ago. It is now at [ORG] as a Featured Article candidate (why not drop by and see if you can help polish it further?). Several people who responded to the original request suggested that a monthly or bi-weekly 'Selected Article' could act as a catalyst for an improvement drive to get more articles up to a higher standard. Although it wasn't quite what I had in mind when I started, this seemed to work pretty well for the [ORG] article, so I've drafted up a process for doing this more regularly. See Portal_talk:Formula_One/Management_of_selected_articles for details. Essentially the suggestion is that we vote for an article to improve every couple of weeks and at the end of the improvement process the article goes on the portal as the new 'Selected Article'. I'd be grateful for any comments on how this might work - I'm sure some of you are more familiar with things 'Wiki' than me - as well as your votes for the next candidate (by 16 July). You may also want to help with the article [PERSON], which was the next most popular after [PERSON]. The idea is to try and get it up to GA standard by 16 July and then put it on the portal as the 'Selected Article'. I hope you can help!"

Command-by-command ? No interpreter is using such crappy technique nowadays. Taw From Interpreted Language/Talk some languages (like Perl) are compiled at runtime Could you elaborate ? Taw Every time a perl script is run, [PERSON] compiles it and then runs the compiled code. At least, this is the usual way of using perl, although it's not the only way. [GPE], 2001 Dec 15 You mean compile to syntactic tree or compile to machine code ? Taw I believe it's compiled to bytecode, much like [PERSON]. As of perl 5.6 (version?), it's possible to produce a bytecode version of a perl program to save the compilation step. I think the bytecode can be converted back to full source as well, but I'm not as sure about that. [PERSON] (http://www.indigoperl.com) produces a perl compiler that produces a machine executable, but I think the resulting executable consists of both the actual bytecode and enough of the perl engine to run the bytecode, so they tend to be rather large. Their advantage is being able to deploy the code to machines that don't necessarily have the [ORG] interpreter installed. They have versions for both Windows and Unix-ish platforms. [PERSON] Old Interpreted Language article An interpreted language is a type of programming language that is not compiled into machine code, but is interpreted at run-time by the computer, and translated into machine understandable code as required. It is often a mistake to refer to a language as either """"interpreted"""" or """"compiled"""", because most languages can be implemented in either way, and some languages (like Perl) are compiled at runtime but behave as if they were interpreted. Other languages, like [PERSON], may be partially compiled into an intermediate form which is then interpreted (although that, too, might be compiled). Some languages, though, are specifically designed to favor interpretation. An example of an interpreted language is JavaScript. Is [PERSON] interpreted, or what? The [PERSON] programming language article says: """"The first implementations of the language used an interpreted virtual machine to achieve portability, and many implementations still do. These implementations produce programs that run more slowly than the fully-compiled programs created by the typical [PERSON] compiler and some later [PERSON] language compilers, so the language suffered a reputation for producing slow programs. More recent implementations of the [PERSON] VM produce programs that run much faster, using multiple techniques."""" The Java language is compiled, always. It is designed as a compiled language, and is implemented as a compiled language. It is often compiled into bytecode, which is then interpreted (with a virtual machine). I think the [PERSON] language article is correct, but maybe it could be worded better. LDC Yes, and you can also compile Jave straight down to machine code if you like. The above claim that it is a mistake to differentiate between interpreted and compiled languages is [ORG] incorrect; every language that has an """"eval"""" statement which lets you construct and evaluate statements on the fly can never be cleanly compiled down to machine code; you will always have to embed an interpreter in your compiled code.

Perhaps you didn't find them funny, but they were meant as attempts at levity during the heated so-called """"Coal Wars"""". I was also not entirely alone in the position I took there on coal which was simply that a paragraph needed to be added to the lead to reflect [ORG]'s [ORG]. I wasn't taking an unreasonable position, and you will now see, that thanks to my tireless, thankless efforts to improve this encylopedia, that information is now in the lead on [ORG].

I have not edited coal since my block, so I'm not quite sure how it makes sense to blocvk me again for something that I haven't gone back to doing. Also, I did not harrass Flyer22. She harrassed me. May I relate the course of events, which you may verify? First of all, I stopped communicating with her since she requested that I do so. Second of all, she got steamed because I added a paragraph on [ORG] to her """"Happiness"""" article under the section """"Philsoophy of Happiness."""" Arguably (as other editors agreed) [PERSON] may have something valuable to say here, and I very quiickly made a summary of the [ORG] article on [ORG]'s moral philosophy on this topic. No, it wasn't perfect and the referencing could have used improvement, but it was better than omitting it and leaving readers with a somewhat one-sided impression of [ORG].

But it was directed to THE MOST RELIABLE source on Philosophy, by general and academic consensus, the [ORG]. It would in fact be very easy to improve a great deal of [ORG] articles by just having editors sum up information from this wonderful free, peer-reviewed, academically rigorous resource. Then, withouit provocation, after I asked her what exactly she found problematic about including [ORG] in a list of philosophers who have written about [ORG], including similar statured luminaries like [PERSON], [PERSON], [PERSON], [PERSON], etc. she responded, not by listing what was wrong with my [ORG] edit, but by telling me """"ALL OF YOUR EDITS ARE POOR, [PERSON] AND SIMPLE.

Since I hate to see a poor soul suffering under the weight of such crushing temptation, I gave in to the temptation myself, and deleted all of my contributions from this encylopedia. Within hours, a throng of rebellion began to emerge,. a grass-roots protest movement which demanded the immediate return of all the much-loved [PERSON] edits to the encylopedia. Editors rushed to my defense. I told Flyer22 to eat crow and admit that, contra her opinion, my Hume edits and contributions to this beloved tome of knowledge were not so poor after all. She declined and escalated her attacks.

[ORG] (born on August 2, 1934 in [GPE], [GPE]) is a Turkish scientist specializing in theoretical chemistry and molecular biology. In his autobiographical book which titled """"The Turkish Einstein Oktay Sinanoglu Book""""[1] he describes himself as: """"A person who was the world's youngest professor in the last 300 years,""""[2] """"at the peak of the science in the U.S.A.,""""[3] """"a man who reached the level to say, """"I'm God"""" in science,""""[4] """"the Lord of the U.S.A.,""""[5] and """"The Turkish Einstein.""""[6] Childhood and High School Years (1934-1953) Sinanoğlu was born on August 2, 1934 in [GPE], [GPE], where his father (Nüzhet Haşim Sinanoğlu) served as a consul general. In 1939 - at the beginning of World War II - the family returned to [GPE]. He graduated high school in [GPE] in the year 1953. This high school's name was """"Ankara Maarif College"""" since 1951.[7] The courses in mathematics, physics, chemistry, and biology in this school had been given by English teachers in the English language since 1949.[8][9] [GPE] learned the English language very well in this high school. Serving American Military Intelligence at the age of 18 In his autobiographical book entitled """"Turkish Einstein Oktay Sinanoglu Book,"""" which was published in [GPE] in the Turkish language (first printing in October 2001 and 70. printing in April 2011, a bestseller: 150,000 copies), he stated that, in the summer holiday 1952-1953, he applied to the JAMMAT """"Joint American Military Mission for Aid to [GPE]"""" (renamed [ORG] in 1958)[10][11][12] to get a job as a translator. His application was accepted by [ORG] in [GPE], and he was sent on duty to [PERSON] as translator for [ORG] and Sergeant Peterson.[13] After graduating high school in 1953, a scholarship was given to him by [ORG] to study chemistry in the United States.[14] According to the agreement, students were elected by [ORG] in [GPE], but funding of the scholarship was provided by the government of [GPE], because Turkish students will return after graduation in the [GPE] to become teachers in [GPE]. [GPE] was sent with this expectation to the [GPE] [ORG] in the [GPE] (1953-1960) He arrived in [GPE] on September 25, 1953.[15] According to his autobiographical book mentioned above, he stayed one year in [GPE] [clarification needed], after which he went to [GPE] and graduated from [ORG], in 1956, with highest honors in chemical engineering. Afterwards, in eight months, he earned a Master's degree with highest honors from [ORG] (1957); and after this, in two years, he finished his doctorate at [ORG] (1959).[16] Subsequently, he finished a one-year postdoctoral research appointment at [ORG], [ORG] (1959-1960).[17] So, his pupilage ended in 1960. Violating Scholarship Agreement and Military Service Obligation to Live in the U.S.A. According to the 1953 scholarship agreement, after graduation, [GPE] was obligated to return to [GPE] to teach chemistry to Turkish students.[18] Sinanoglu stated in his autobiographical book that: """"Returning to [GPE] to teach chemistry to Turkish students in the English language was worse than death, a horrible and dishonorable thing. İnstead of this, to stay in the [GPE] and to teach chemistry to American students in the English language was a more honorable thing. I swore that: I will not return to [GPE]; I will stay in the [GPE] and I will be a chemistry teacher in American universities.”[19] So [GPE] violated the 1953 scholarship agreement and did not return to [GPE]. But there was a second problem: According to the military service obligation laws of his country, after finishing his studies in 1960, [GPE] was to return to [GPE] to fulfill an 18-month military service obligation. The penalty for violating the scholarship agreement was a fine: the payment of a sum of money. But the penalty for violating one's military service obligation was the cancellation of one's passport and visa; this penalty could not be paid by money in those years (1960s). He stated in his autobiographical book: """"Theoretical Physicist Feza Gursey wrote a letter to me inviting me to [ORG] which was being established in [GPE], [GPE]. But I couldn't return to [GPE] because of the military service obligation. If I went to [GPE], I would be a soldier for 2-2,5 years.""""[20] An easy way to stay in the [GPE] was to marry and father a child in that country. A Brief First"

I've heard something vague about [ORG] keeping short files in the [ORG]; if this is true, it indeed isn't represented right now. This is correct. Tail packing and suballocation put multiple files into one block, but that is still discontigous from any other related information, like the inode block or directory listing. By contrast, [ORG] stores data for *very* short (I don't have an exact number, but it's in the several hundred bytes region) files in the directory listing, which entirely eliminates a seek for the data. Perhaps a note of this fact in a footnote for the """"partial"""" suballocation support? """

The layout and image choice in A appears to be better balanced than B, however as someone pointed out above, the image has not scaled well to the size displayed in the collapse boxes above so that needs to be improved. Correct balancing is important, and the oversized top aerial shot at the top of B unbalances the rest of that image. On the second choice, C is broadly a better picture. While it shows more of the structure itself, the image composition on D is way off - the skyline is inappropriately placed in the bottom third and because of its angle it gives the spires undue attention and creates a vast area of empty sky.

You also need to know that there is absolutely no evidence for the claims from Debian. Repeating a false claim thousands of times does not make it correct, but Debian just uses copies of their false claims to """"proove"""" their claims. So what remains? The only provable facts are that Debian started to attack cdrtools in spring 2004 and that Debian at the same time stopped distributing the original cdrtools in favor of their own defective fork from spring 2004 that was later reamed (on my instructions) in autumn 2006.

This is going to be fun . — Preceding unsigned comment added by 109.78.243.56 If you want to be a disruptive, arguementative, combative editor, go ahead. Such editors usually end up being indefinately blocked. Actually the vast majority of broadband [ORG]'s are never static as far as i'm as i'm aware, so unless you create an actual account to edit with, you will end up with a different [ORG] every different day or week you appear unless it cycles back to one you've already used.

You show your own lack of knowledge of Irish history anyways. What was [PERSON], someone you can call a loyalist, described as at his funeral? As a proud Ulsterman and Irishman. [PERSON] himself was a proud Irishman but can also be easily classified as a loyalist. They always said the [ORG] was mostly due to ignorance and prejudice - especially towards history. If you really want to make a difference on [GPE] and be somewhat successful at doing so the best way is to play by [PERSON] rules and not by being disruptive or coming out with childish remarks such as """"stop crying"""" or implying threats.

6142887fe5d1bf7c,0,0,0,0,0,0,"I just mentioned the social conflict, because the contemporary crisis of [ORG] was less a conflict between [ORG] and Reform movement, but a social gap between a ruling minority, consisting of families which had bound together religious authorities, academics and wealthy merchants through marriages, and a ruled majority in the Jewish communities and town ghettos whose poverty had dramatically increased. This is not only the social context of the conflicts between [PERSON] and [PERSON] or Maskilim and Reform Rabbis, but also between Orthodox authorities and mystic movements like Hasidism. Hasidim in [GPE] and [GPE] usually understood much better the problems of the poor population than any [PERSON] among the West Yiddish Ashkenazim in [GPE] or Western regions of [GPE]. And Polish nationalists and among them, Polish Jews who lived in the larger [ORG] and visited the universities in [GPE], [GPE], [GPE] and [PERSON], formed a governing elite in [LOC] – the parlament of the crownland [PERSON]. The rural communities of [GPE] was another “uncivilized” world for modern Jews in [GPE], [GPE], [GPE], [GPE] and [GPE]. [PERSON] from [GPE] as a student of [PERSON] must have appeared like a mooncalf. Their hopes focussed on a revolution in 1848 and it failed again. [PERSON] certainly belonged to the privileged minority of the [GPE] and his circle was the upper class of [GPE], but this does not mean that they were not disappointed about the backwards conditions in [GPE], whatever faith they had. Wealthy members like the brothers Humboldt or Polish aristocrats were very engaged to improve the social conditions. They founded universities, hospitals, they improved the working conditions of coal miners etc. If I compare them with wealthy people today in [GPE], I can assure that they were much less ignorant. Otherwise they were also very intolerant people (especially around [GPE] in [GPE]) like the demagogues who cause the hep [PERSON], so [PERSON] and his pupils had to go the ghetto to protect their inhabitants... But like [PERSON] [PERSON]’s social sphere had an impact on his concept of modern [ORG]. As a pedagogue he wanted to teach Jewish children German, Hebrew and Greek, but he refused [PERSON] as a corrupt dialect, which finally meant to refuse the prospering culture (literature and drama) of East Yiddish and the Ashkenazim world from [PERSON] to [GPE]. From the point of view of [GPE], [GPE] was admired as a radical philosopher of [ORG], but the reason behind his radical attitude was the extreme pressure of assimilation, that the Jewish population had to suffer in [GPE]. For this reason I was a little bit surprised about your categorization of [PERSON] as an Orthodox Jew. Conversion finally remained the main access into the ruling elite of [GPE] which can be easily analyzed by the cynical statements of [PERSON] (especially his commentaries of the [ORG] circles around the children and grandchildren: “He [Felix] is the grandson of the great philosopher [PERSON], but he has nothing better to do than to set the lamb’s piss into music!”). I just collect here all these names and places, in order to demonstrate how open the category of [ORG] should be. And I still see no reason how to exclude [PERSON]."

All pseudo subbjects are all lies as the [PERSON] have alredy answered all those points in different places of the web, [PERSON], at different times, for the past 2 years. For 13 days ago there was absolutely nothing more to discuss about, and seeing that, [PERSON] used his ususal tactic who is to do as if they din't have answered the questions at hand, and that way, confuse the other users and make them believe that it was the case, as he has always done since 2003. Someone has to stand up and say it, someone has to put an end to this circus, and I choose to do so. I do not have followed the story from the beginning and do not know the Bogdanov but through this affair, that I begin to interest myself with since the beginning og august. Two things became clear for me as I scanned all the web on the subjects: [PERSON] was the person doing all the staging, and [PERSON] didn't knew what he was talking about. I also found out that no matter how many times and in how many languages and by how many specialists the answers were given to him, he will keep asking and accusing peoples, and agress them personnally and accuse them of not being edicated in that field or critisized their university or making threat at contacting their chiefs, and even insult them to push them away from the discussion platform, as this kind of people represented a real threat to his status. And of course, especially when we are talking of the scientific platform like in fr. physic or scent physic, those people, [ORG] or professor at university were not used at being roll around with nor being talking to that way and even less at being insulted and confronted with non argumentativ methods. So they left and never show up again, leeving all free room that [ORG] could ever wish for to pursue his goal. But what was this goal exactly? It wasn't the truth as he kept lying and had been given all answers, and was often denying to have done certain things who were appearing very often. He was repeating himself and soon I saw a pattern emerging, from all his apparitions on the web, with falsh accusations, lies, home made stories, fantasyfull evidences, links to web sites from his own making, agression, personal attacs, insults. His goal was not at all to discuss science but to manipulate others and he managed to do so very well as he was allowed to fool so many for such a long time. T>wo years is a very long time for a little subject as this one. Then I was contacted by people who had been confronted to him, prior to this case, and had been subject to the same attacks and methods on the web. I stude it, and saw worse than I could ever imagined. It was all planed from the beginning and a part of an ideologie with filosofical pretenses on how one could manipulate other people meaning by creating a situation on line. It is what they call Post situationism, and wich is issued of [GPE]. In the previous case against a teacher that he knew from school and a women writer (on cooking books!) he had just met [PERSON] but been found of him for a longer time, by the beginning of [LOC] affair he had been introduce inside the rangs of [ORG], and as the affair progressed assured himself a high status in this """"confrerie"""". That is the reason why this article I come with is of such importance. It reveal what was behind all along, what motivated the principal actors of this mascarade, and show all that they have been manipulated from the beginning and still are. There is no Bogdanov affair, it is an illusion, a part from a group of ideologs making a thinking experiment and giving life to it by means of the internet. [PERSON]! Unless there was casualties. And there is. Plenty of, and more than the [PERSON] private sphere and their career.
